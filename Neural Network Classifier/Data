Illegal to receive land-mobile telephone service?  Don't you have to have a
mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service?  What about
ship-to-shore telephone service?

Isin't there some kind of rule (regulation, law, whatever) in some
juristictions that prohibit the use of *police band* recievers
in vehicles?  And that radar transmissions are included in the police band 
so they get covered by the same regulation?

Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.
It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.
Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and 
X Windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.

Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.

all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip

But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.

I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
first and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  They came in Chocolate,
strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed
like space foil at the time).  

The taste is hard to describe, although I remember it fondly.  It was
most certainly more ""candy"" than say a modern ""Power Bar.""  Sort of
a toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
approximation of the taste.  Strawberry sucked.

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than
nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").  
3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best.  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs.  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area.

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical
""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.
It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure.

True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory.

In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  

Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.

If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet
is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will
be added to the list of targets.  We'll have by then over two years
of Earth-based observations to help narrow down the positions of the
pieces of the comet. It probably won't be too much different than
what was done with Gaspra.

Galileo did not image Toutatis.  That came from Earth-based radar.

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that ""aura of deterrence,"" critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
""contribution to society.""  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

It's about time.

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 85

#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade:		I (B)

It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had
only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he
has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... Peter Ahola.

#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
Grade:		I (B)

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high
expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be
Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.

#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,
he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (?)

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.
Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+)

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours
truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (D+/D)

He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is
quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.

I flipped on my local Cable Access Channel (a channel where any
community member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50
per half hour) and saw a ""documentary"" (I use this term loosely)
on the conflict in the West Bank.

It was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was
terrible, and the camera was really jumpy).  The documentary (sic)
told the tales of all of the children who died in the ""war"" against
the Jews as martyrs.  

It was a regular sob story.  One ""victimized youth"" was recounting
on how all he ""really"" wants to do is to get an education and that
the big bad Jews won't let him go to high school.  He admittedly 
spent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a Jewish woman
but claims that it was ""for the cause.""

I have seen this kind of garbage before.  I have a lot of sympathy for
the Palestinian cause (as do many Jews), but I think that even many
Arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary!

The most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end
was an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM. ON
THE MIDDLE EAST.

Anybody heard of them?  They make Peace Now look like right-wingers.

Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
And that was my original point.

I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than
gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,
Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to ""clean up
diesel emissions"".  Is there anything in the works to
install ""scrubbers"" for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...

Please get it right, Jon.
(This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes,
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the once-pristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)

The dominant correlation is NT <-> Phlegmatic (and _not_ NT <-> Choleric).
One of the semantic roots of ""choleric"" is the idea of ""hot"" (emotional)
and one of the semantic roots of ""phlegmatic"" is ""cold"" (unemotional).

NEXT MEETING


The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights 
of Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.  
Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman 
trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant 
Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University 
Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in 
transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is 
a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and 
always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a 
very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our 
hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence 
will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be 
cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome 
Dr. Teperman. 

          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE


LAST MEETING

It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of 
TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being 
able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  
No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored 
again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island 
Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many 
braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good 
conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, 
a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not 
able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to 
discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, 
an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient 
was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman 
gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, 
(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to 
minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine 
and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank 
her for an entertaining evening.



ANNUAL MEETING

In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is 
also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official 
notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main 
purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit 
member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and 
to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two 
year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following 
slate for the Board.

         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen
         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith
         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia
         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)
         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)
         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)
         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)

Those remaining on the Board for another year are:

         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)
         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn
         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy
         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)
         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)
         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)

This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work 
and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have 
backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition 
to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also 
be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board 
members and there is plenty of work. 

In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be 
given and the floor will be open for any new business, 
suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.

We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the 
majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.

FUTURE MEETINGS

Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  

     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry
                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center

     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony 
                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. 

Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.

NOTDAW

The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor 
Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, 
speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and 
Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   
because of two year's experience with miserable weather. 

We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We 
have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish 
a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to 
address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of 
life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample 
letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.

DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED 

The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will 
hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the 
Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas 
Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and 
are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne 
Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.

MEMBERSHIP NEWS 

Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant 
in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing 
well after only 12 days in hospital.

Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston 
Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation 
works!  We hope the national press notices. 
     
Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his 
transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis 
and feeling better.  

Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, 
spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems 
encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  
They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will 
continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. 

Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall 
that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a 
candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.
 
And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough 
winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.

SEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE

 Currently there are no ""Velcro"" jump boots as issue in
the military, there are two other kinds. One is made my
Cochran and sell for $85.00 in either the Clothing sales
store or US Cavalry (Price match at the Cav store) the
second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design.
Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they
are 10 eyelets high.
There is another boot called a ""Tankers boot"" this has
similar construction to a wellington boot except for the
boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness.
Nice boots

The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,
faxes and phone calls.  Certainly, with our way-cool Internet powers of
organization, we can act in the same way, if such action is appropriate.

As long as we are kept informed of events, anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action.  Hopefully, we're a strong enough community to act on
those calls.  I realize this is a little optomistic, and I'm glad EFF is
working in the loop on these issues, but don't underestimate the
potential of the net for political action.

In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps
involves acknowleding a ""higher power"".  AA and other 12-step abuse-
recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.

Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating
that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes 
people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but
still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to
Christianity.)

I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ-
ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves
as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists
necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are
right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly
to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists
are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to
refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God,
as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.)

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first GM to ""waste"" high draft choices
on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,
and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more
years in his prime.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.

I don't know a whole lot on Proton, but given that it is a multi stage
rocket,  up to 4 stages, it may not really need the Centaur,  plus
it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.   

Also, the centaur is not small,  unless the Proton has an oversize
shroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it.

I'd be fascinated to see such evidence, please send me your article!
On the negative side however, I suspect that any such simplistic link
    abstinence-education => decreased pregnancy,
    contraceptive-education => increased pregnancy
is false.  The US, which I'd guess has one of the largest proportion of 
""non-liberal"" sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
teenage pregnancy rates.  (Please correct me if my guess is wrong.)

	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't

I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
difference.

Well, I'm working on it, but getting a little impatient. So far, 
I've made it through Egyptian, Chinese, and Greek cultures, and
up through the Rennaisance. But so far, these insights just don't 
seem to be gelling. Perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere.

In its own right, though, the history is kind of fun. Lots of 
good yarns in there, with varied and interesting characters. And,
more to come.

Currently, he's all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.

I've seen PGP 2.2 mentioned for the Mac platform. I use 2.0 on MS/DOS.
Is there a 2.2 for MS/DOS? If so, a site or two that has it available
(I'd need executables, although source would be nice to review).

Here is another anecdotal story.  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different
dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went
home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs.
I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in
my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm
not allergic to anything that I know of.  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*
a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.  
I haven't gotten sick yet.

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was

performance). Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly

From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping
as it should.  To turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.

    He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isn't
really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from
the USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending.

    I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than 
Canada does.  This is a true apples - apples comparison where the previous
post was apples - oranges.

Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

Women who are known not to want abortion services, for example,

Seeing as how people are willing to quote the FBI quoting cultists

You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who
can declare ""total"" victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged ""quotations"" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin ""massacre.""

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.
At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
""quotations"" that support your preset opinions.

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your ""quotations"" have an axe to grind, and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you ""quote.""  For
example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,
and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience
shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his
anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be
considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
""quotation"" that you can use to attack Israel.

Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a ""scholar""
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an
attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,
you will see his ""indictment"" to be pure hot air.  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as
""scholarly,"" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.

The Deir Yassin ""massacre"" never took place as the propagandists
tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila ""massacres."" Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for ""massacres,"" even if
they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews
like to do it, for reasons of their own.

Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin ""massacre"" stuff
with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it.

If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves,
I would not trust Mitre either.  Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least
in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the
shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and
I assume in other, less open, programs.

There are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development
Corporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis.  Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I
am neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position to
exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand.  It could
just say, ""If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation
contracts with Aerospace and IDA.""

I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonest
folk.  But since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the
system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be
independent really are.

And, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.

Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.

    April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world
are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members
by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.  
    At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,
and it is important to note that those who deny that this event
ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate
the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,
would like to see it happen again...

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!

Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much

Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?

>Sin is fun!  Let's

Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.

I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''
That's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to
Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip,
then Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.''
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are
talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key
approaches.

The protocol/key-management description published so far is either
incomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system
would actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that
we get full details.

Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear

Via K_P, of course.  Nothing was said about where K_P comes from.  It's
the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose
session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc.
But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow

Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political

he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or
via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

	After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to
add.

	First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption
privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,
and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,
after all IS the bottom line. 

	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who
still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think
of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make
mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 

	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.

	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid
people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the 
built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 


	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do
not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,
the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and
unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.
	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box
has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree.

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
And a can of WD40 helped...

The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use
some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...

Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.

Flipped the bottom spring and then...

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 ...

A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  
Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go
to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.

One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD
been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must 
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move 
it back... hmmm...).

After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.

BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.
At least it now sits level..

This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe

wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and

  Note the clause ""more forcibly"", above.     My point is that they have

  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of
Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked 
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 

  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. 

  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the  
Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  
absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  
from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  
partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  
defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.

First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  
idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  
claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  
bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  
to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  
promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  
possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  
national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  
is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  
and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  
continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  
can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  
Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  
the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  
Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  
leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  
going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town  
on a rail.

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
indicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, ""Now, is he
stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
_red_ rear indicators?""  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's
braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
rear indicator.

Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations, doing
a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software
Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates
it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000/200. That
machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000.

First the scriptural quotations:

This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,

of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would

 The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger
does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact
the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.

Finally:

There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits
communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief
without logical proof.  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for
rational western man, myself included.

I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a 
rejection of the resurrection's occurance.  I beleive, but I wanted to point 
out the weakness of logical proofs.

No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's
because they're implemented by a single card.

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,

I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word

History: when I had a Deskjet 500, I had to modify the macro so that
it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
interferred with printing envelops.  That bug is still present, however...

Now: the problem I have is that my DeskJet 550 print driver (came with
the printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops in
PORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from the
narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to print
the envelops in the correct orientation?

     There is no such thing as ""completely secure,"" especially when dealing

Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details
when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based
on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.  

It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage:
husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before
each other and God that you will convenant together to be
married, then...you are (IMO).

So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be
there for ""connectedness"" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers
and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some
accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept
from Hebrews about ""not forsaking the assembling of yourselves
together as is the custom of some.""  We need each other because
Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a
self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone
see the Paul Simon ""I am a rock, I am an island..."" model anywhere
in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?

Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA
and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go
crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to
obey them to avoid even the appearance of ""evil"" (I Thess 5:22)

So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage,
but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the 
conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are
married when you and your intended promise each other and God
to be in convenant. (IMO)

What ch'all think ?

Bobby - akgua!rjb

[In some states, the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto's
posting can create a common law marriage.  Indeed his posting itself
might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists,
should the issue ever end up in court.  He might want to consult a
lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state.  --clh]

While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also
worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer
from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were
cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated
within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms
fire can not be made for field pieces.

As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for
the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them
was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does
come to mind however, 

Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and
that their stated position is:
	1.  No peace talks.
	2.  No peace talks.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	N-1. No peace talks.
	N.  No Israel

if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for
peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?

I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria.
I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see
Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria
could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion
would lead to a second pullout.

I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.  The main
problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
the system.  I hope they will fix that.  But I'm afraid, as usual,
the local doc is going to take the brunt.  People grouse about paying

I agree.  Where in the Gospels does Jesus advocate any of the actions

I couldn't find ""witch"" or ""sorceress"" in my concordance.  Is there
something in the Epistles about witches?  (I'm still working my way

(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED
SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)

I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of
how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now*
mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ'. 

The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.

And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter
may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival,
but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to
honor any kind of ""pagan goddess"" by celebrating Easter.

It is nonsense to say ""this word (or this practice) 'really' means so-
and-so even though nobody realizes it.""  Words and practices don't mean
things, people do.  

(This is basic semantics; I'm a linguist; they pay me to think about
things like this.)

There may be some confusion here.  The Uniform Crime Reports program

Charley,

I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your
previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once
again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for
you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the
questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may
address them one at a time for all to see.

Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I
will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or
you cease to post to this newsgroup.

I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these
questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be
kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it
from this list.

Now, to the questions...

1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological
patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating
that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some
atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed
to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your
stereotype?

Here is the context for the question:

>>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line
>>> in assuming that it is.
>>
>>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean
>>to imply that everybody's experience was along the same lines.  
>
>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so
>repeatedly.  
>
>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name
>those atheists that you've come across who *do not* fit into the
>patterns that you theorize?


2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that ""senses and
reason are all we have to go by"", and when pressed, you have implied
that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly
asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both
experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses
and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can

4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as
a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the
""axioms"" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked
you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement
that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that
I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer
the question.  Please do so now.

Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become
atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that
effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the
subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably
result in atheism?

Here is the context for the question:

Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,
Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote
from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not
disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the
Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially
in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom
13-14).

True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the
books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole
argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not
universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and
others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for
the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the
Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I
think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of
Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament
only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.

	You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I
will explain below.

""That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,
except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of
Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five
books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of
Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],
The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being
Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were
formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two
books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of
the New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the
Apostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same
to the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the
Apostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of
John.""
	-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)

	This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage
(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which
council the same list was enumerated with the words ""Because we have
recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the
Church.""  Which ought to quiet those who assert ""in the name of Holy
Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was
never any doubt in the Church,"" as the Episcopal Church does in removing
the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians
hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not
counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The
Lutherans hold out similarly.)
	Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also
be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it
divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.

""And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as
consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the
number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also
that by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,
corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.""
	-St. Hillary of Poitiers, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" prologue, 15 (365 AD)

""The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with
Lamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is
Maccabees.""
	-Origen, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" Psalm 1 (245 AD)

""Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to
the boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].""
	-St. Clement of Alexandria, ""The Instuctor of Children,"" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)

""....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of
Solomon, and also Wisdom ...""
	-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' ""History of the
Church,"" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14

""It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine
Scriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must
shun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;
Ecclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of
Maccabees, two books.""
	-St. Damasus I, Pope, ""The Decree of Damsus,"" section 2 (382 AD)

	I would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church
has always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed
by various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament
deutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2
Peter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither
should it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that
the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding
of the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a
canon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian
use of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early
as 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the
Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants
apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree
of the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, and
that he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the
canon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some
80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and
not the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.

This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My

build large, inflatable space structures.

If this is true, I think it's a great idea.

Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be
shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space
station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.
(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)
If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so
much the better.

>Is NASA really supporting this junk?

And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild
idea"" stage or does it have real funding?

>Are protesting groups being organized in the States?

Not yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return

Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.

I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.
The summary:

CTX 14"": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.

CTX 15"" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.
  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning
  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.

I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay
shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. 

It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron
(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.

Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to
send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it,
but has good potential.

    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU
    - 64kb SRAM cache
    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $150 alone)
    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1
    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS


Please do not post/email saying ""but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone
386/90 for only $9.95 including a free toaster!"". I am *certain* you can
find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat. *New* Micronics
CPUs command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are US-made,
use high-quality components, and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible. They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and
Zeos at various points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages
of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself.)

Price: $495 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply. The board is fully guaranteed. Email for further details
or for any questions.

Thanks!

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

So I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips, at least not

I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:

The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will
NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,
the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested
who is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige.

My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My
mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
(at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go
to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in
Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from
my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to
the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem
with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare
not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My
work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices
in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based
on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.

The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities
undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command
the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal
institution and works with minimal funds.

Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published 
several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.

I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in
a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.

Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I 
am writing. By the way, that ""bullshit"" is justly regarded as the first 
instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.
For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived 
on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet 
and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The 
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its 
Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, 
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have 
 been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they

 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse

 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of

 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration 
camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the
short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the 
cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party 
leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by 
this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia
(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it
had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who
could be expected to oppose their plans. 

On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even 
though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over
60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the 
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left 
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few 
Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British
soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. 

Rawlinson wired to his superiors, 

""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control,
 atrocities were constantly being committed.""

""The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have 
 recently taken over is given below:

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered, have been destroyed,
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the two-year Russian occupation.

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.

 As to the people of these cities:

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people,
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the 
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls
 and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than
 those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,
 horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in
 Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and 
 Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have 
 been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely
 massacred.

 Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions.""

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.

Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has
to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing
on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:

* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future

* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,
but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better
output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to
program).

Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/
names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit

They certainly are until the Arabs make peace.  Only the most leftist/Arabist

	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape
is harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are 
very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While
there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to
get your hands on and costs quite a bit.

	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an
NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by
modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this
would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy
animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.

	Otherwise, see if your local public access cable

*cough* *choke*  WHAT?!?  if a cop gave me a ticket for ""sounding"" like
i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
because ""sounding"" like speeding is ridiculous.  if i was found guilty
i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer.

if a cop doesn't do one of:

VASCAR (from car or plane)
RADAR, LIDAR, other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a
cop ""seeing"" me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but
""he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone"" is not ""beyond a
reasonable doubt"".  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured
by eye???  take it to court for sure.

I purchased a Super Voyager VLB 33Mhz board from Washburn & Company a month ago.
I don't have the mailing address-- Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week.  He can also be reached via CompuServe.    The phone number is    
1-800-836-8027.

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about
concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.

  I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows
in 1280x1024.  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro, and I'm pretty
sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select
1024x768x65536.   But no matter what I do with the Flex program
in the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out.
I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The
drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's
a file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.
  I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.  Sometimes
it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit
OK and re-enter Desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  At no time does
it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window.  Help!

This is a general question for US readers:

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost
impossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had
an opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because
I'm in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with 
coverage, and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even
locally in the US and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if
the games go into double-OT.

Email me so as not to waste bandwidth, please.  My news feed is kind of slow
anyways.

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to
""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets
the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport""
mode entail?  several things:

1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)

2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the
	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching)

3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is
	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.

also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a
5 speed)?  

how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will
be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high
revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.

Subject: Re: electronic odometers (was: Used BMW Question ..... ???)
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine

I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The
design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat
ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit
difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The
secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint
of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid
exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.
The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect
at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading
by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an
automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in
operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your
1993 RX-7!

The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions
under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and
velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to
collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the
drivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer
currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading
out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion
of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your
driving style, it could also provide valuable information from
actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.
I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving
demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-
time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results
I would love to see that.

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center, I can only be charged with

I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're
fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like
a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards
arrive, I'll buy one.

well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort
of ""anti-belief"" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that
you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that
sense of ""difference"", however, when they are associated with ""those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan"".  if you'll excuse
the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her
differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.

you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to
discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn
from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become
stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers
to those questions, it is weak and untrue.

in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you

ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an
open heart -- including people of ""our own camp"" with whom we
completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith,
nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our
religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a
christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want
to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some
point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity,
not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.
The ""whole Russian strategy"" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,
who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most
notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).

Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the 
league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.

I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some have
been positive but most are negative. Could people please confirm
these?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular).

1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.

2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches
   set but it is much slower.

3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.

4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
   cases.

5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.

6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)

Thanks for your feedback. I will summarize.

Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you

mating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to
disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating

No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it

Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones.

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although
it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean ""bisexuality?""

That's right.  The goals themselves aren't inherent.

But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be

   If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the 
   Pope cannot ""be wrong!""  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter 
   of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the
   Pope is the legal head of the church.

   In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice
   but to obey.

This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is
more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's the
idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.
This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.

The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and
well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can
make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.

A couple historical examples come to mind.

Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the
English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning
Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop
Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though
maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even
when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just
collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.
This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop
Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!

Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.
He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific
Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a
defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to
defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic
doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.
He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In
the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he
recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the
Church.

If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such
subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you
will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall
into heresy or schism.

The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope
must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.
A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the
Catholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no
legal *or* moral force.

the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say
something.

Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest
suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the
Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death
of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break
down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there
is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If
Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill
them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.
There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under
attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are
living together peacefully.

The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two
different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into
Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have
promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be
a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those
attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be
defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in
Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was
possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once
that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were
expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of
agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted
Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior
would have disqualified this from being a holy war.

The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by
Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel
for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a
judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay
of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because
illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God
for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't
justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that
in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as
*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's
people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were
actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.
Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are
judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through
his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to
Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,
I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that
doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from
judgement.

I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue
because of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented
nations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that
Christians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the
mid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite
serious.

That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between
Hollywood's ""Old West"" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks,
saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the
thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that
this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who
insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while
they really did care when thugs preyed on others.

We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work.
Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation
is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used
criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine
guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about
guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other
guns.

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the
original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the

the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent

If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost.

If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the
payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this
turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car.

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car.

At least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

If you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you.  If you are working

static XrmOptionDescRec options[] = {

#define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]))
XrmParseCommand(db, options, Number(options), ""MyApplication"", &argc, argv);

Then use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using
XParseGeometry().

It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv, however, I much prefer
using the X resource management routines to do this.

                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach
                              April 3,1993

     Most of you, as am I, are ""children of the 1960's.""  We grew
up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,
nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were
miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits
have told us - ""you've lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is only
living on the accomplishments of the past.

     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We
listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living
history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell
of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as
General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle
- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand
dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only
of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.
Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the
best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and
Poseidon ballistic missiles.

     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. 
This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened
to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. 
And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let
me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus
behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest
engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your
insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated
into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.

     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a
single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You
advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are
all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You
convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld
its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a
prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the
generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental
aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little
and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who
started this program for the SDI.

     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even
start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a
little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they
moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more
before putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - you
didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to
take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable
aerospace transportation is real.

     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same
team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic
Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -
launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about
a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our
commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet
Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored
the importance of our work in bringing about a new international
relationship.

     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the
framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the
next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.

     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This
summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the
first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three
years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space
rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And
yes - we'll make a little money off it too!

     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to
build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of
space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the
rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. 
What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to
counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!

     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to
the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn
V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra
dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital
system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the
way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket
exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the
world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at
hand!

     This project is real.  The torch of American technological
greatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is
American.  Let's go fly it!

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
the next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few
different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when
I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any
compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able
to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch
without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed
and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further
reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course
I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
route it directly to the mother board.

I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the
voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is
reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,
a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon
as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.

Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a
common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the
first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all
property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops
went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford
privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry
D. Westbrook:  ""The change was immediately justified by the increased
industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.""

Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  ""The
experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried
sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the
vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of
later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into
a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser
than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much
confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been
to their benefit and comfort.""

Bradford did not blame this failure on the ""strangers"", but on the basic
selfishness in all men.  He wrote ""seeing all men have this corruption in
them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.""  In other
words, according to Westbrook, ""Bradford found private enterprise to be
the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.""

Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private
property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings
starvation, poverty and discontent.

Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences,
and that ""rules"" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a
*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is 
taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease
for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed
blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare
say all of us would be walking into walls.

Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*
careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for 
sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the
result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was
blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any
other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with 
diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as
debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a
specific behavior or lifestyle?
>
>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.
>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?
>I don't know.

Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark
about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.
The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central
message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,
and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of
our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for
our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He
has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or 
some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting
on the sacrifice that Jesus made.

In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when
I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other
socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,
no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think
it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus
healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on
this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.
She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed 
relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,
but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining
weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is
excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes
her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who
are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It
seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.

Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I 
think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I
(or something like that).

May we all experience and accept God's grace.

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US.

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.
Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.

The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).
 And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is
just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the
inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to
grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are
doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it
must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to
the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is
possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the
eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts
now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing
people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and
Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His
plan might be accomplished.
    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to
execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to
fulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd in
Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,
which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish
other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. 
Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene,
tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's
justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians
as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the
extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. 
The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and
the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go
on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is
quite clear.
Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to
question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,
He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans
9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of
Jesus Christ is as follows: ""Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Let
the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infinite
amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to
follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright,
you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your
plans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""I'm just a sweety-pie
who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and
Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior""
Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the
world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be
questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on
force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able
to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers

No.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation.]

My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart

of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate
Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.

The results:

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the
(drumroll please) LCIII.  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with
the Quadra line.  The Centris line pales in comparison.

Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the
disparity in graphics/processor performance?

That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to
import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build
their teams around local players.

I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some
time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
""crucial"" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland
probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way
American/Canadian fans do. Call it ""the Minnesota North Stars"" effect:
Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive
hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.
Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the
American networks likely never will pay.

Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a 
'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these

   Environment:

      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3
      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)
      Motif	: 1.2.2

I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
to X server lost):

   1. xinit -- Xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:

  ""Connection to X server lost""

or
  
  ""Connection broken (errno=32)""

(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:

  select returns -1
  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560


Note:
 * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
 * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
 * I am not running font server. 
 * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.
 * My font path:
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi

   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).

 * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations.

Questions:
 * What the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * What does ""status 2560"" mean (of the server).

I'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the

There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure
you'd be of great help to, say, the Leafs as an assistant coach or

As summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made...

Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local
state forests. For that I was planning to get a backpack/rucksack. 
The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given
the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12"" high) and
was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.

Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?

Taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully
loaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to 
be very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load 
clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting, 
do I still increase my chances of surfing?


Collective r.m. wisdom requested.  


p.s. I really can't afford leather pants. Boots and jeans are
all I can make do with. What you think of the knee protectors
which rollerbladers use - the one L.L.Bean and like sells. Is 
that a Bad Idea (tm). Are there any equivalents?

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector, but sacrifice portability.

Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.

On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.

Organization: Software Metrics Inc.
Lines: 76
NNTP-Posting-Host: rodan.uu.net

This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an ""OS"").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.

Koberg,

	Just a couple of minor corrections here...

	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in
tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to
Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in
Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.

	2)  I'm not sure what you mean by ""signifying believers""  but it
should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it
ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. 
The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is
that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming
a Christian in which one is ""Baptized in the Holy Spirit""  That may be
what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order
to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the
majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in
Mark 16 about ""these signs following them that believe"" but they generally
do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't
""saved"".

	3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that
has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big
generalizations here.  Do ""Neo-Pentecostals"" only believe in tongues as a
sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? 
I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them
as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as
a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be
inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,
they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be
charismatic.

I currently use a window manager called ctwm which
is very similar to hp's vuewm. (i.e.

it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate

ideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.
but every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the 
white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if
you're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to 
actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)
it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the 
american indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one 
group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as
equal - ain't that some stuff)

white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have
wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.  

just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a 
position.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.

hmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history

You think that's bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in
the playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with
BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I
was talking about ...

While it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces
the same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions
and zero promotion (okay, I don't watch that much TV so I'm just foaming
all right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable
before going to the networks.  In year one of the new ESPN contract, the
saturation coverage of SCA (all other games shown to completion, like
the Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes) is missed around here.

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in 
tomatoes?

Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer.

People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?
How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?

On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a ""bad""
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me ""Why we never
received your old chips.""  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied ""You mean you sent them
US Mail?"" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to ""make it right.""

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never
buy another product from them again.

The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is

When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0
If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be
zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete
the square on x, y, and z to obtain

I think Scalia's point was that you get one chance.  If new information

the governor is feeling charitable.

The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*
married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.

e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall
leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''
(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).

If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the
phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This
implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the
point of intercourse.

Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary
was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were
*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which
required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary
and Joseph went to bed together.

Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is
described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes 
place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with
Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will
take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,
because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.

In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is
not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the
point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the
civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)
Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a
marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since
Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be
corrected on that point!)

This view obviously raises some questions:

What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering
marriage. Are those people also ``married''?

If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary
to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours
the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep
together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-
honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before
actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and
also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction

If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for

This sounds real nice, but struck me as a little odd.  You're 
presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian, who is sticking
his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support 
of gays in the church.  But I was under the impression that you
yourself are gay.  That's all well and fine, but presenting yourself 
as sticking out your neck to help ""repressed others"" seems a bit 
untruthful under the circumstances....

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping

Just a quick comment. Backup lights mounted on the side

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years -- nervous.

For the Leafs sake, I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game 2.  If game 1 is indicative of the series, it's gonna go
quick.

4/15/93 1242  Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan

By SEVA ULMAN
   
ANKARA, Turkey (UPI) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help
it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave, 
the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was
responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.

""We are giving a positive response to all requests"" from Azerbaijan, ""within
the limits of our capabilities,"" he said.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature
of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework 
of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to
Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.

Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a
high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second
time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.

Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer
defeat at the hands of the Armenians. ""We feel ourselves bound to help
Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)
help may take in the future,"" he said.

He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, ""and the whole world knows
about it.""

Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get
militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be 
based on street-level excitement, he said.

There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on
Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were
captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and 
helicopters.

The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border
with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local
people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has 
occurred, the sources said.

The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared
early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later
positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

                          The Briefing Room



1:04 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  
	     
	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out 
to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.
	     
	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You 
said it was a good visit, but no compromise.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk 
with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there 
were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very 
good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as 
well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe 
Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not 
speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the 
President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close 
of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the 
President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked 
about that yesterday afternoon.
	     
	     At the close of that discussion they said that they 
would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator 
was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific 
compromises made on either side, they did say that they would 
continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.
	     
	     Q	  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are 
both making concessions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that 
phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said 
consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  
He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to 
take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to 
make those adjustments.
	     
	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.
	     
	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes --
	     
	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made, but what would 
lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go 
down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said 
this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a 
number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked 
at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been 
made.
	     
	     Q	  To follow, have they done that directly through 
him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President 
about it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although 
there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the 
VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task 
force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the 
possible options would be?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been 
presented for a decision, no.
	     
	     Q	  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an 
option?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of 
briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the 
President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  
	     
	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being 
considered, though, are you?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.
	     
	     Q	  He knew that.
	     
	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  
That's what I'm asking.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being 
considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been 
over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I 
don't even know that it's --
	     
	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at 
this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're 
getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is 
considered -- 
	     
	     Q	  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed 
it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just 
repeated. 
	     
	     Q	  George, is there any concern here that as a result 
of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if 
it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out 
the way it did, that there may now be the development of a 
credibility gap on this issue and others?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is 
now public knowledge that this is being considered.
	     
	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute 
statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it 
was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it 
come out not from you people, but --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out 
from the administration.  What are you talking about?
	     
	     Q	  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said 
he would let us know. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.
	     
	     Q	  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that 
it's not going to be on the program.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.
	     
	     Q	  On March 25th. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.
	     
	     Q	  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out 
by rooting around in the fine print of an interview
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do 
a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --
(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys 
write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the 
Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right 
here, and AP story -- ""Clinton wants more money for spying.""
	     
	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being 
considered, he'd tell us about it?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, 
and he'd let you know.
	     
	     Q	  And did he?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say 
this morning?
	     
	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of 
me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his 
administration.  That is his administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they 
orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they 
answered the questions.
	     
	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be 
dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were 
considering it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  
Painfully clear.
	     
	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making 
it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being 
considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they 
answered that it was being considered.
	     
	     Q	  George, The New York Times --
	     
	     Q	  Why do it yesterday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.
	     
	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary 
Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and 
oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures 
in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, 
but which turned out to be totally false.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally 
false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor 
Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they 
say that. 
	     
	     Q	  The question is, is the President concerned about 
behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he 
doing about it, if so?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a 
mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the 
matter.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the 
President?
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of 
information.  I think that's where the confusion was.
	     
	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake 
that was made?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.
	     
	     Q	  And as far as you know, is the President aware of 
it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.
	     
	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in 
The New York Times?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.
	     
	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  
Anything?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.
	     
	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on 
this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both 
statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that 
mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said 
it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.
	     
	     Q	  Did they drop it -- is this something that you 
choose to spin or make an issue of?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of 
work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to 
get this jobs package going.
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a 
minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an 
amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment 
would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in 
the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting 
that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no 
changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the 
timing like that.
	     
	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer 
this week than you were last week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going 
to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make 
adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the 
votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's 
going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes 
deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.
	     
	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation 
has changed?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on 
it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.
	     
	     Q	  George, last week you said that there are -- or 
various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go 
through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because 
he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the 
compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could 
accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've 
realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted 
to talk to the President about the stimulus package.
	     
	     Q	  He initiated the conversation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, 
the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You 
say he's making --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly 
what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that 
there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, 
and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President 
doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get 
it through, he will.
	     
	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was 
working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before 
the actual vote.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.
	     
	     Q	  Today?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will 
happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward 
with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come 
forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the 
first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you 
tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase 
is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how 
detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the 
package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday 
afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today 
in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator 
Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific 
compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  
And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that 
we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.
	     
	     Q	  What are the follow-up discussions if not the 
President and Dole?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going 
to talk to Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, 
how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the 
President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation 
in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they 
talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked 
about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the 
level of this many x-billion dollars. 
	     
	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a 
package?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the 
protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole 
was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.
	     
	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators 
Kohl or Feingold?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, 
no.
	     
	     Q	  George, is the President considering the more 
palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the 
haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going 
to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves 
having to pay for the have-nots?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that 
the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his 
budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your 
question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, 
you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money 
that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is 
not true.  It's actually waste water money.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for 
Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem 
because it's waste water money, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment 
overall. 
	     
	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other 
day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  
Would you agree that's not the case?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I 
know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.
	     
	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning, which was, 
when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating 
on a VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just 
don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between 
the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  
	     
	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know 
the exact date.
	     
	     Q	  George, the President this morning mentioned that 
some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the 
National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax 
being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel 
that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, 
or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already 
proposed?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to 
say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is 
being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  
The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't 
be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the 
income tax, for instance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on 
that.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, 
Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you 
think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it 
have a chance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it 
forward?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration 
if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration 
now.
	     
	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that 
circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under 
consideration.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to 
this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something 
that has to be considered.
	     
	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  
That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled 
it out that groups have asked it to be considered?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that true?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin 
taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the 
deliberations.
	     
	     Q	  But, George --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as 
the President said, groups came forward and said this is something 
you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his 
prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups -- how that 
information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading 
the newspaper or did groups make presentations?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, 
the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.
	     
	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these 
groups had come forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what 
was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been 
published positions in the newspapers.
	     
	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's 
presentations to them?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him 
-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the 
working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these 
groups.
	     
	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that 
were persuasive enough that the President would change the position 
that he had enunciated previously?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had 
longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance 
health care.
	     
	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding 
positions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  
Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the 
basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.
	     
	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're 
telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this 
change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February 
and now --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't 
necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  I know, but the President said that it was off the 
table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's 
changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also 
describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  
If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been 
made to the President --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the 
presentations to the health care task force.
	     
	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact 
that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he 
favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested 
that they would produce all the revenue.
	     
	     Q	  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were 
appropriate ways to finance health care.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that 
he said anything to refute that.
	     
	     Q	  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that 
there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind 
of core benefits --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task 
force ever suggested that there would.
	     
	     Q	  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break 
his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his 
programs?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical 
situation.
	     	  
	     Q	  But does that promise -- would that promise not to 
raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him 
from seeking a VAT tax?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions 
on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the 
implications then.
	     
	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, 
labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task 
force has prompted this consideration?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just 
don't have that.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us to what extend these other 
alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or 
other financing options are also still on the table and what these 
options are?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force 
and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking 
at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that 
there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not 
going to comment --
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on 
them, no.
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you 
talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task 
force is looking at.
	     
	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the 
Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the 
President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his 
task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and 
the remark about market access at the press conference?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?
	     
	     Q	  Does no mean yes.
	     
	     Q	  Yes and no.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the 
Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question 
about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when 
he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that 
certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the 
President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and 
the U.S. that we want to do something about.
	     
	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he 
suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in 
terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state 
our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit 
very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your 
characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.
	     
	     Q	     that we need specific export targets, specific 
numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with 
Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad 
discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into 
those specifics until after the meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Why?
	     
	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or 
not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical 
targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of 
hopeless that this is going to change very much?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must 
have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not 
want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus 
package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants 
to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister 
Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to 
be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary 
Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do 
more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to 
work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to 
press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I 
think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and 
we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral 
packages.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work 
with all our allies to do as much as we can.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today 
Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on 
the Bosnia policy.  And he said, ""It's a rather emotional response.""  
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.
	     
	     Q	  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  
House condone that kind of remark?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary 
Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also 
that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find 
answers for. 
	     
	     Q	  But that specific -- ""rather emotional response"" -- 
specific term?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.
	     
	     Q	  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with 
the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it 
good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now 
to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?
	     
	     Q	  To take stronger action, to take military action -- 
air strikes, anything that can be done?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what 
must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as 
you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms 
embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase 
pressure at this time.
	     
	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say 
that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain 
the presidency?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard 
for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard 
for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the 
arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen 
getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said 
that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that 
change your thinking?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to 
whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to 
say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions 
and talking about the arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She 
said she would be able to provide some administration officials who 
could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are 
you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.
	     
	     Q	  That's exactly what she said.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But 
what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of 
evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are 
connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and 
we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have 
an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, 
what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact 
effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods 
into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What 
kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't 
know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at 
all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.
	     
	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be 
released?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  
And it will be probably later today.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive 
order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work 
force as part of the gay rights march here next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal 
for that at this time, not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during 
the campaign that he would do.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't 
think it's anything that's on his plate right now.
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point 
on this issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  
I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of 
different groups and communities.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked.
	     
	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  How long --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I 
don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major 
speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but 
I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to 
give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not 
exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like 
that.
	     
	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of 
the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific 
timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under 
discussion and something we've been working on.
	     
	     Q	  Campaign finance reform?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
	     
	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working 
on?  I missed the question.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  
He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know 
anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working 
on.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented 
in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out 
of town on the day of the march?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate 
meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a 
speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston 
on Sunday, as he did last year.
	     
	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you 
on the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?
	     
	     Q	  On the gays.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the 
President's schedule for the day, certainly.
	     
	     Q?	    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is 
that Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.
	     
	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how 
long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't 
know.
	     
	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting 
-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you 
about it.
	     
	     Q	  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the 
first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in 
the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's 
not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration 
gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White 
House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make 
sure --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do 
anything like that.
	     
	     Q	  Certainly not.
	     
	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to 
General Vessey?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for 
about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was 
he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will 
obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  
The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting 
and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes 
in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's 
response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look 
into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on 
remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to 
military archives.  
	     
	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the 
activities of the joint commission and on the document.
	     
	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis 
at this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's 
also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the 
Vietnamese.
	     
	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that 
they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, 
non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to 
as Americans from time to time.  Do people -- 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final 
determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we 
have it, we'll make a judgment.
	     
	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination, but 
given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that 
that's a likely possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize 
it in any way until the review is complete.
	     
	     Q	  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech 
in Boston?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. 
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference 
tomorrow with Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  
Yes, I expect, yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 
	     
	     Q	  He was in on the meeting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, 
and the answer is yes. 
	     
	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal 
report this morning the President's distressed about some of his 
press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I 
think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied 
that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would 
point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than 
any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --
	     
	     Q	  How many questions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 
occasions.
	     
	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very 
good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the 
article also implied that these questions were only answered at 
tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  
He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval 
Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to 
questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --
	     
	     Q	  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --
East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval 
Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the 
Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington 
Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local 
television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The 
Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. 
He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and 
Connecticut --
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The 
article implies that he doesn't --
	     
	     Q	  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?
	     
	     Q	  The story is that you -- are you held responsible 
for it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment 
about this.
	     
	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown 
displeasure publicly?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the 
discussions between the President and myself.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris 
Webber?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?
	     
	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball 
player?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.
	     
	     Q	  That is an authentic letter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in 
February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should 
be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  
Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a 
proposal he hasn't made.
	     
	     Q	  George, does the President have some agenda for 
this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a 
general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about 
including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.
	     
	     Q	  The military issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.
	     
	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.
	     
	     Q	  George, what specifically is the President doing to 
prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had 
general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the 
Trade Representative and others.
	     
	     Q	     report yet?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report 
referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him 
today.
	     
	     Q	  He was?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the 
report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press 
hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was 
that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he 
feels that way?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the 
record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, 
I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The 
thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the 
President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he 
has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent 
history.

	     Q	  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.  
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

                                 END                    1:34 P.M. EDT

I've used X11R5 with classics set for both 1024x768 and 1152x900 (you

Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused
""objective morality"" to look very ""relative.""  After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an ""objective"" morality for us.
That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. 

	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.

However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
""objective"" morality for us. 

Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the ""subjectivity"" of principles. 

	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in
	verses 21-22:  ""You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...""

The ""objective morality"" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
""objective morality"" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS ""objective
morality.""

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""I
want to
play a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Disclaimer number 2:
If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is about
to end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not
allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

I'm sure that the Motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing

dual-band, fully synthasized HT.  Yes, yes, I know Motorola
HTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based

still work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams
willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied
dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not
a flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.
I'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed
that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-
bander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong
*I* can be.

Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of
non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,
but it's still no more than a guess.
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers.

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a
miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  

You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging
attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you
r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.

Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad

and the printer tries to load another.  The instructions in the manual

   Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast
   as a ""classified patent.""  Patents exist to encourage communications and
   develop the state of the art. 

While there aren't classified patents, there are ""patent secrecy orders"".

Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.
The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy
of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent
application has now been classified for national security reasons and
you're no longer allowed to make and sell it.  
I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.
It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably
violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.

Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and
then file a patent application.  Since it's been published,
they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get
patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.

Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus
""You can't sell that widget, because there's a classified patent on it.
You're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,
so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw
you in jail for espionage.""  Some countries might have that kind of
system :-(, but we don't have that here.  Quite.  Yet.

 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
would be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,
wider and slightly banked. 

Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)
and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south
east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the
left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled
into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't 
a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.
Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and 
over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then
that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he 
had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and 
changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.
I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out 
of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to 
think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not 
left the time he needed to dodge me.

don't assume it will stay that way.

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get

a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards

just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the
lottery at best.

If the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite
simple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.
Let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week.

Subject: Re: Sabbath Admissions 5of5

All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point
pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or
Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really
sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by
the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of
the Chruch to do so.

Andy Byler

[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church
establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is
that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the
ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based
on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'
teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship
occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these
points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more
time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are
right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.

Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to
obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite
clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is
on where the Bible would have us place the line.

By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters
that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to
determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that
the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship
falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or
(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to
decide.

	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is 
still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly
incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints.

If you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, I strongly 
suggest Approach 2.0.  It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I
own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to 
build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have
heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.
Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/
home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I 
have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:
I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to 
use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records 
appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)
exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach 
database), and then copying the exported files back to the original 
filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really 
like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than 
the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also 
takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).

I am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and
international authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences
such as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  But
what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this

you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's ""micro""
conference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the
Balkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out their

decoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time, which
probably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_.
HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they
ever made.

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose
area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want
to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like
BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
fit is iffy.

A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they
finally decided.

I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20.
The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they
both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a ""Intro to Nautilis"", a sample CD
of Kodak pictures, ""From Alice to Ocean"" (a story of a woman who treked across
Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a ""titles""
disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some ""Cinderella"" thing for kids,
a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested,
I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of
""Interesting, but probably fairly useless..."". It was rumored that the earliest 
units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had
that.

This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint
according to some utilitarian principle, i.e. atheism/religion is
wrong because it causes death.  The underlying `moral' is that death
is `wrong'.  This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity.

In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.
Avenil is a 2.0l 4WD/2WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G20 
but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.I mean, it's 
not based on any sedans.) 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here.

Sounds nice. But I doubt they have a plan. Coz Avenil was introduced 
to replace any sedan based wagon.

Intel also makes some neat memory and peripheral chips:

Old technology (early 1980's)  
8155  ram plus IO (slow ram as I recall)
8755  eprom plus IO (expensive and slow)


Intel does make Eproms with built in address latches.
I fear that you would need a very flexible and up-to-date eprom

give them a call.  I am not able to locate their memory products book

Buck Showalter just can't win. 

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks
lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,
and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.
So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.

Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks
lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, ""I don't want a repeat of that
near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work."" Steve Howe,
whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't
do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the
Royals win it, 6-5.

What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,
Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the
deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our
bullpen turns to shit!

What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?

I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now.  They have been talking
about a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here.  One
day the ""last hurdle"" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new
hurdle.  Fans have been grumbling about Foxboro Stadium (or whatever it's
called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary
proposals for a new stadium.  Local politics prevents anything from being
done in a timely fashion.  There will not be a new ballpark in my
lifetime.

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.

Note that ""(the celestial bodies)"" in the above verse is an
interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's 
(incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.

Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation (he studied Arabic for his
research into the Qur'an and science) of this verse:

""(God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon.
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion."" (Qur'an :33)

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for
a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
(or anywhere in the Qur'an).

Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis


Dear Josh

I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.

Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.

1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards
identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.
citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are
just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic
country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or
religious identity to any public official who so requests ?

2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all
kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.
You did not respond to my question.

3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is
interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear
weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?

4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a
Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases
like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about
those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and
imprisoned.

5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status
of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I
understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for
the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).
The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,
why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?

6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return
conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands
of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under
Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from
returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also
left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to
return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?
Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge
somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in
his homeland ?

7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an
order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that
information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all
inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These
expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other
atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by
Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the
Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University
Press. Is this book available in your library ?

8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in
Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very
little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many
Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are
not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want
Arabs ?

9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was
whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to
discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but
evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants
to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious
communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish
civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests
to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a
secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.


I would be glad to have some more input from you after these
comments.

Elias

(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe
monitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and
OS/2.)

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or
this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the
signature).

Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've
collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision
of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows
with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files
will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have
worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not
anything resembling an officially supported set.

As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:
1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can
   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in
   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).
2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of
   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.
3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability
   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking
   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play
   around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable
   about what you're doing.
4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files
   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.
   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.

THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your
warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many
monitors.

Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually
c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation
diskette to change your adapter or settings.

Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  
You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.

Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS
files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.

Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by
sentence.


1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human
species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?

2) Science cannot explain origins.

This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends
on what origins we are talking about.

3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins
is to say that there is no higher truth than science.

Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of ""higher
truth"" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways
to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even
believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many
believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language
of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither ""higher"" or 
""lower""; they are simply true.

More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science
does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the
scope of discussion.

4) This is a false premise.

If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false
then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another
false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.

5) By the way, I enjoy science.

On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science
to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say
that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.
However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,
perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.

6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.

Let us not quibble; count this one as true.

7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent
religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]

Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true
with the following contextual modification:

""Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent
of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of
what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.""

-----

It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch
on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do
him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his
personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that
he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.

Thanks to a reply from someone I looked a little further and found what

Anybody know how '93 Honda Civic hatchbacks and Toyota Tercels fare in

Hello,
  I just got some SIMMs,  at least one of which does not work. I don't know if 
there is a software that can test SIMMs thoroughly or I could just rely on the 
RAM test performed by my computer during the start up. When I installed a dead 
SIMM into an LC or  an LC II, there would be a strange music and no display on 
the screen. Why? I need your help! Thanks in advance

All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year 
moon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.

If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally 
reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as 
Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh 
ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.

But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

Could it work with the moon? Who are the far-sighted financial backers of 
today?

Well, as long as we're being unduly cocky here, It's obvious that the Pens
will cone out of the Patrick Division *not* the Caps, and also that
they will win thier third Stanley Cup. ""Collective Wisdom"" is a very polite
way of putting it, I don't know if I'd be so gracious.
And, for what it's worth (Probably not much) I think the Habs will come out of
the Adams too.

Keywords: Mr.Owl, how many licks...
Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha
Lines: 227


	-------------------------------------
	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      
	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + 
	-------------------------------------
	---this file last updated..4-21-93---


WHAT IS OTIS?

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
and distribution.  Digital immortality.

The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
there...and someone will dig them up.  
 
If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is 
breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
 
Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what they're here for.

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE?             

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  
 
 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site
		
	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 
	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)

Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin""
command to make sure you're in binary.

OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North
America....the following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff...
	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?
              
What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put
it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,
it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works
are also welcome.

OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  
GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  
you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format. 

OTIS also accepts animation files.      

When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
emailing).

If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send
copies to:

The OTIS Project
c/o Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha, NE 68124-1113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  
Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named, include those as well.  
 
Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
contact me and we'll arrange things.

If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5""
disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,
but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or
JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
not have to.

At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
get a slab-o-OTIS.

As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
Email me for current archive size and directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION?

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images.  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

USE?

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for    
the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the 
Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email
me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact information.
 
When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING IMAGES?

Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep
the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number.
Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CREATING IMAGE FILES?

When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,
address or other information you'd like people to know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HMMM?!

That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed.
Your input is expected.

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  
 	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,

	     however.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original 
 	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  
	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone
	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  
    	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS
	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights
	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 
	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 
	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     
	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is
	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or
	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 
	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        
	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific
	     permission for this sort of usage.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".  If you know of people
that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm
in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...

I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign, he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However,
during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of
State Christopher stated that ""the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties"".

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can

When the you are asked to swear ""So help you god"" and you have to say it, ask which one; Jesus,
Allah, Vishnu, Zues, Odin.  Get them to be specific.   Don't be obnoxious, just humbly ask, then

DEPOSITION OF KARINE (KARINA) GRIGOREVNA M. [1]

Born 1964
Secretary-Typist

Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization

Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15
Microdistrict No. 3

On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,
at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards 
away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" 
Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at 
the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation 
whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it 
was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if 
someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There 
were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that 
large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the
film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well 
mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an 
Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that 
they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do 
to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded 
a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move 
over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone 
recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. 
It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's
only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. 
Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, 
people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the 
auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and 
gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've 
scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to 
me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of 
""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like 
they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing 
had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful 
films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We 
could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, 
and it was dark . . .

Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin
Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, 
something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially 
listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to 
make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation 
wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, 
policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors 
there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-
stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some 
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, 
since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super 
serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we 
live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was
dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the 
driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and 
he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, 
OK . . .

So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was 
happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation 
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going 
to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's
immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had 
come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to 
cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,
just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma 
down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though 
nothing had happened.

That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and 
didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.
That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't
guess.

On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always
had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, 
Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and 
no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that 
morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at
home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda 
Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did
our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something
awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what 
are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like 
that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels
like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The 
cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.

Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy 
problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,
asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what she
was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home 
and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,
she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I 
tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see 
you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can 
see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was 
ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the 
table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything 
out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.
We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. 
We cleared the table.

We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't 
see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people 
. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking
somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's 
an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down
to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story 
buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 
people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see 
several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide
that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not 
killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of 
the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their 
feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in 
general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak
. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .
If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he
got up and left or not.

I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our
place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd 
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and 
starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors 
are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is 
shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it 
turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and 
kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop 
them.

They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,
afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the 
windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, 
and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't 
crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge
cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey 
Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear 
tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous 
din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were 
shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or
something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma 
says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part 
of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there, 
they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them 
that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in 
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say 
that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I 
can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak 
Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and
Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told 
her anything or not.

Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,
leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I
tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what
has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I 
say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the 
apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the
doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them.
Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have
pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, 
commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?""

And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one
room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start 
undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, 
in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how 
much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,
and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The 
atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among 
themselves who would go first.

Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes
in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. 
He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It 
seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything
depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beating
Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs 
. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was
out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the 
window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the 
windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking 
about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong 
person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that
I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, 
which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they 
don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I 
humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my
tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing 
. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.

I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't 
know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by 
my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, 
something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone
else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death 
come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near
the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What 
happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.
 
I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me 
clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember 
that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, 
what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make 
sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he
served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all 
went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his 
courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though 
he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he 
served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served
there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor 
brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, 
""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who 
and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then
Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when 
they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda 
said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the
Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going 
to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's 
hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our 
sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding 
on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in 
there. So they survived.

My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.
While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back 
up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed 
there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put 
it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the
one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and 
knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you 
in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings 
and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because of
what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a 
moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came 
back to our place and lay under the bed . . .

I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone 
number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he 
came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were 
simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.
There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, 
it was hard to breathe . . .

My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our 
administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary 
passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right 
after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a 
great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and
what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not 
only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, 
without stopping. After us.

I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from
Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died
from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young 
Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. 
Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives
to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in 
Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run
quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay
alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment 
three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such
awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, 
there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything 
out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face
was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my
normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to 
scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you 
here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of 
the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the 
Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the 
Daghestan police were there.

When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,
there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously 
injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they 
were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda 
and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't 
know what to do with the rest.""

So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My 
boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter
what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department
head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She 
examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait 
ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People 
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.

That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, 
""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and 
says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been
doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal 
with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this 
condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't 
have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to 
think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then they
brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her 
own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next 
morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This
was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything 
more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, 
nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at 
them.

I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-
pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face
was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask 
your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can 
better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw 
themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward.

Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me 
clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, 
but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up 
above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such a
short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my 
ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and 
brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I 
couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said
that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one 
had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . 
Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should 
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an 
Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must 
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something 
else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on
the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.

The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, 
and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to
the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.
I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many 
troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw 
a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought 
that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait 
after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't 
come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. 
I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm 
me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw 
a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each 
other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to 
see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed 
interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they 
could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues 
who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, 
neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what 
happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart 
. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, 
not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part 
of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by
myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my
lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I 
lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be 
from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.
When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of 
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. 
There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took 
me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were 
emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's 
friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. 
They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I
needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty
breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.
They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some
people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I
wasn't cut.

They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon 
appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not 
talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We 
demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov 
is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, 
""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same 
things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you 
agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This 
went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us 
out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because 
they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The 
smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who 
had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a 
club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay 
to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day 
someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.
Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie 
theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it 
was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants 
took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in 
Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to 
mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting 
right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only 
the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women 
were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come 
any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered 
together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie 
theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to 
the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and 
couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently 
they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the
theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my 
eyes.

Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an 
Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" They
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did
not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in 
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like
they should have, with their IDs.

So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On
Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't 
spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,
they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered 
the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-
in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only 
the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, 
she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the 
building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. 
This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were 
already in the city.

They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire 
families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians
or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't 
see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult 
now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify 
the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard 
that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, 
including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in
Microdistrict 3.

They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who 
had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were 
going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply 
savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did 
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that 
hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians
out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from 
the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the 
ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira
G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and 
she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and 
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that 
whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and 
carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.

I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of 
people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a 
song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has 
that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, 
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They 
couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and
called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,
she couldn't remember anyone's face.

I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had 
talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw
the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She
goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at
the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the 
Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met 
with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint 
meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from
Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of 
those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.

They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the
Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-
tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They
showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our
case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were
the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were 
dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch 
me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these 
people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were
all from Kafan.

The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was 
there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't 
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since
I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away 
and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina 
anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out 
anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became 
myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people 
there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his 
name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one 
we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If
he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his 
alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not 
responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, 
myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back 
again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and 
I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally
different before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is 
being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me 
that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. 
What are they doing with Rzayev?
Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the 
head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an 
insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the 
same time

I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-
ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one
wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what
exactly I can't say.                                                     

When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, 
because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got
it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it 
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my 
face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, 
they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he
works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, 
is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ 
dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even
have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our 
building was killed, it was that man.

A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come 
over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was 
all over, people started making announcements in town saying that 
investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now 
they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been
beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he 
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy 
came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the 
bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,
went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday
night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do 
you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, 
probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't
say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, 
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had 
killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of 
that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that 
the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from

I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with
them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word 
I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an 
Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. 
His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from 
Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. 
His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani 
KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many 
photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at 
curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, 
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a 
haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he 
is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, 
I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. 
At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, 
all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look
at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like 
you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything 
without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when 
she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over
the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the
balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had 
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. 
They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that 
moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the 
faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the 
apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and 
no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have 
anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the 
apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the 
apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they 
know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that
Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the 
building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis 
lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our 
apartment.

I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt 
when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would
have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but
probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at
a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were
being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have
been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from 
our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we 
saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to 
me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been 
able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani 
woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated 
woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two 
Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She 
came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my dead
body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some 
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't 
even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well
what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They 
couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani 
stopped them.

They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place 
they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the 
apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? 
Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is 
some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed 
to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had 
come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They
didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They 
screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"" 
Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun 
literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy.""

That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an
Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their 
kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part 
of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find
Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,
but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the
courage to . . .

A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 
to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the 
Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the 
fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where 
the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a 
little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to 
wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were 
bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma
thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and 
Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, 
bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had 
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and 
tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having 
trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and 
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted 
to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by 
accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, 
""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and 
find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or 
murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that 
moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that 
someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out 
from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought 
she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to 
herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from 
under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost
her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that 
way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled 
down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from
outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it
happened in.

And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting 
something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or 
less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I 
tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen;
let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how 
long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, all
women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe 
not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that 
for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She
says, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the 
night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son
Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were 
coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He 
shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a 
lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my 
knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,
out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his 
wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to 
leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, 
they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, 
maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over
there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished 
building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more 
or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.

Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom
apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,
Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that
time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and
her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started
pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, 
something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even 
live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and 
mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. 
They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My 
God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the 
lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who 
knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but 
they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that 
he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his 
apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up 
at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.
They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of
us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this 
apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing 
in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were 
standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the 
first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time 
to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty 
pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really 
mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, 
""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that
direction.

Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, 
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They 
just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, 
she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told 
me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, 
the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?""
And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn't
know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She
came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the 
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took 
flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been 
standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there 
to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she 
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in 
the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and 
when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't 
just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .

After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really 
didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and 
started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. 
Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people 
who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think 
that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but 
they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole 
brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been
enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's 
all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not 
one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were 
standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are
you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women 
that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for 
one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, 
an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: 
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed 
to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they
stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If
you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left.
That trick didn't work on them.

Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget 
that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it
had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, 
then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. 
And no one did anything. Anything.

I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this.  I've
got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
what they say.  They are 2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and
Galatians 1:11-12.  

Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
people if they follow him (see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27) and that
those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
(see John 12:47-50), then Jesus' words are true and do not need
interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
if it had to be interpreted.

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the
reference here with me.

The article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide
whether a given (cubic) Bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points
or whatever wierdness. The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89
course notes for the course called ""Math for Siggraph"" or something like
that.

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or 
even gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and 
the doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placebo 
effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine 
and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the 
medicine?

Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a 
medicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees 
more improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effect 
called?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor 
doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than 
there is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effects 
ever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you in

- 101 Keyboard
- 200 Watt power supply
- Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0
- *3* years limited warranty
- 1 year on-site service

I'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15"" flat-screen digital monitor, and
will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra).

Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one
I'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service.
Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support,
and comparable prices (I see FastMicro just bit it...).

Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says.   


Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of
years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,
once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes
David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes
Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent
takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up
comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.
Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS
agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
""I am."" 

While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known
Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is
different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.
What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of
Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different
perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's
testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  

Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  ""I am"".  He has
revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).
Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.

Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? 
Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer
programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near
complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that
that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious
display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than
King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?

Praise God!  I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been
accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena, CA.  I've been working long and hard to try to
get in there and have said many hours of prayer.  I'm very excited for
this opportunity, but also very nervous about it.

I'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student.  I'd also
appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
about Fuller, Pasadena, or California in general, like good places to
have fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be
good for me to know.  Also, if anyone knows of any foundations that 
might have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know!
Of course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)

The contract for my current job is over at the end of April.  I'll be
taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to
Pasadena.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get net.access next fall, although
Fuller doesn't have it itself.

I've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their
earnest search to please God.  Thanks to our moderator for providing
such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news
group.

May God bless you all.  Vaya con Dios, mi amigas y amigos.

Keywords: ellipse


Hi! Everyone,

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess
my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere.

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold
internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most
importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated. Please give me a hint.

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.
However, so many people involved in the problem ""sphere from 4 poits"".
Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
summary of the answers).

As much as I considered some of the (so-called) Islam-related dialogue

20:52 P.S.T.  I come to my senses and accept the all-knowing
wisdom and power of the Quran and Allah.  Not only that, but Allah 
himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice. Allah rolls a
few bones and we get down.  Then Allah gets out the Crisco, bends 
over, and invites me to take a spin around the block.  Wow.

20:56 P.S.T.  I realize that maybe Allah is looking for more of a 
commitment than I'm ready for, so I say ""Man, I've got some

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop
such people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at a
bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this
*sport* has not reached us here in Fresno.

Now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.  This

Which type of morality are you talking about?  In a natural sense, it
is not at all immoral to harm another species (as long as it doesn't

Hi all,

I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that
class type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance.

Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance
handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the
DLL (page 934).

I have two questions:

1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?

2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of
    the DLL?

Thanks in advance,

Dear Netters:

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.
Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the

In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,
and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine
ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one
stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something
about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem
too bad if one ""beats"" on his car.

I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any
problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.

Thanks for any responses!

A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential

intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other
headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist
can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the

Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even
after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic
examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,
salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask ""why can't you
order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?""  Aunt Millie often gets
into the conversation, as in ""they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches
for years"", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or
whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a
patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear
what your magic is.

Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.
Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,
but the patient feels like ""something is being done"" (as if the
hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were
""nothing""), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper
than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.

I think I've seen this bike.  Is it all white, with a sea-green stripe
and just 'HONDA' for decals, I've seen such a bike numerous times over
by Sewall hall at CU, and I thought it was a race-prepped CBR. 
I didn't see it over at the EC parking lot (I buzzed over there on my 
way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR?  I would imagine so, 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  When I first saw it, I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage.

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from
various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]

The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.
Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points
between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more
complicated.

Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective""
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final
assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.

The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
Japanese/Far East equivalents.

Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van
Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.

Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

Hi!

One of the ASPI-drivers (I think it's the ASPICD) supports a /NORST
paramter, which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads. This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec+tosh

As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was
based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out
spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,
because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that
the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were
""melting in fear.""  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and
knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt
uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On
the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values
held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in
out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual
warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.

The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites
take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except
for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about
Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that
the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered
me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I
shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in
Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.
Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians
who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing
God's work?

[The example of God's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest
has always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally question
whether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe they
were consider that the wars were justified only because they were
specifically commanded by God.  Somehow I don't see the Serbs behaving
like a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh]

It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)

For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop.
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.

Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

  I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a ""deterrent"" to crime. If so,
why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive
wouldn't it ???

  The death penalty is a punishment, much like a $50 fine for speeding is
a punishment. Anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care
about the consequences. I think another problem is that people dont think
they will get caught. If I wanted to kill another person, I wouldn't 
care what the penalty was if I didn't think I would get caught.

  If it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along 
the lines of torture.

Honesty?  Perhaps you would explain the testimony from members

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,
I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)

		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks
			    Resulting in Death
			    
	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4
	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2

It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns
that they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were
so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide
would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in
cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show
a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this
not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife
attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks
(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),
the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the
proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.

What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on
the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended
to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave
physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the
head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this
pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of
rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  
: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  
: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  
: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  
: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not
fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and
Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic
differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found
myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I
don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent
crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every
law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.

On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,
seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities
with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.

In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After
a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed
weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.

In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason
to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.
Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are
regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a
restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in
order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns
transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.
In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.

Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for
gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers
studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),
burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from
1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same
standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.

Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver
(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).
18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in
Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /
1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher
(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by
weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.
Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated
assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were
far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.

Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle
(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).
After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as
compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.

When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate
of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in
Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.
Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to
a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns
accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns
were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than
in Vancouver.

The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable""
homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during
the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only
21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in
Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After
excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these
earlier findings.

-------

This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the
argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because
Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times
that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports
annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.

Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access
to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because
persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a
gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.
If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by
the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we
could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to
be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study
interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns
was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that
few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.

As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding
citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did
experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these
cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities
during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,
Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category
over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for
self-defense.

DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN

   Born 1940
   Foreman
   Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1)

   Resident at Building 36/7, Apartment 9
   Block 14
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


During the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of February], I
was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-
work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the
Nagorno Karabagh region.

After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically
in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said ""uprising"" in
Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a 
demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the 
Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even 
women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, 
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the
Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.
I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew 
wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really 
bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,
""There's unrest everywhere, be careful."" Well I had a project going on. I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on 
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they 
said, ""Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the 
police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you."" 
Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he 
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This
man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and 
afterward he spent the night with us, too.

I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, ""The situation is
very tense, be careful.""

We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I
shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's
business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it 
and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, 
they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out 
they knew what was happening in Sumgait.

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the 
buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private
drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, ""Let's go find some other way to get
there."" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait.

He took us there. But the others had said, ""I wouldn't go if you gave me a
thousand rubles."" ""Why?"" ""Because they're burning the city and killing the
Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left."" Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we 
set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, ""In fact there aren't any
Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" Well 
I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, 
""How old are you, old man?"" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not 
saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. ""How old are you?"" he asks 
me. I say, ""I'm 47."" ""I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'."" I say, ""It 
depends on God, each person's life in this world is different."" I look much
older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was
silent, too.

We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he
was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with
them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us.

I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the 
street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They
stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature 
shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .

Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's 
not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak 
their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for 
""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. The 
pronunciations are different. Anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not 
Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, 
""There was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""They started 
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the
people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" I only saw 
the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back . . .

When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,
his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""We're
Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here."" He did come up to me when 
we were pulling our things out and says, ""Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?"" 
But in Azerbaijani I say, ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" And . . . he 
left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had 
to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own 
home.

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store 
and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I 
saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I 
couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it 
was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing 
remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I
saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About
30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.

I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are
closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the
crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.
Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. 
Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the 
soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one 
armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning 
off Sumgait.

I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by 
their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I
joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us
and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.
But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly 
recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer
people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.
I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as 
to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking 
behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: ""Comrades, the Armenian-
Azerbaijani war has begun!""

The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around 
the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off 
behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, 
and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every
corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were 
doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But 
the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least
find out if my children were alive or not . . .

    I was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.
On the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was
in mid-flight, the game completely froze. A couple seconds later, the
screen went completely black, with an error message in large ""Bubble""
letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering
I am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on
an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or
Intellevision years ago). Oh yeah, after the message, there was also
what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex
code that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE??? It must have,
my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this.

Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 29

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the

I can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is
looks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out

If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they
should put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's

	Ahhh, remember the days of Yesterday?  When we were only

	When only 1.2% of the population would pay extra taxes?

	Remember when a few of us predicted that it wasn't true?  :)
	Remember the Inaugural?   Dancing and Singing!  Liberation
	at last!  

	Well, figure *this* out:

	5% VAT, estimated to raise $60-100 Billion per year ( on CNN )
	Work it out, chum...

	     $60,000,000,000  /  125,000,000 taxpayers = $480 / year

        But, you exclaim, "" I'll get FREE HEALTH CARE! ""
	But, I exclaim, "" No, you won't! ""

	This is only for that poor 37 million who have none.  Not for
	YOU, chum. :)  That comes LATER.

	Add in the estimates of the energy tax costs - $300-500 / year

	Plus, all that extra ""corporate and rich"" taxes that will 
	trickle down, and what do you have?

	$1,000 / year, just like I said two months ago.

	And, the best part?   You don't GET ANYTHING for it.

	Deficit is STILL projected to rise at same rate it's  been
	rising at, by CLINTON'S OWN ESTIMATES.  And this assumes that
	his plan WILL WORK!

	I mean, come on, it doesn't take a ROCKET SCIENTIST to see
	that in another 2 or 3 years, we're GETTING ANOTHER WHOPPING
	TAX INCREASE, because the deficit will STILL be GROWING 
	FASTER THAN the ECONOMY.

	All Clinton is doing, is moving us to a HIGHER diving board.

        Face it.  Clinton is Bush X 2.  In four more years, our
	country will be completely bankrupt, and your children's
	future, so oft mentioned by Pal Bill, will be gone.

I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the
remaining Persian troops on the second round, and then 1/11 of those remaining
on the third round.  This would mean

Answer: a*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/4)*(1 - 1/11) = 280  -->  a = 821.333

Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left 
out the part about ""we all ate the same thing.""  Changes things a bit, eh?

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

>>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?

I don't think Northrup ever had a plant on Long Island.  The two main airframe

I think Sperry also started there.  If you're ever in the area check out the

A question in general about displaying NTSC through a Mac.

If I understand correctly, the Video Spigot can display NTSC
in a small window as well as capture the data in Quicktime
format.

However, if I want to use a larger window, what are my options?
Perhaps I misunderstood the Video Spigot review...  

Also, I am not interested in Quicktime.  I would merely like to
use my Mac as a television from time to time.  I have a nice
Sony 1430 monitor, and I would like to use it as a second TV
when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular TV.  

Perhaps some of the video cards for the Mac accept NTSC input?
I have a IIsi, and I am willing to buy a NuBus adapter.

HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
subjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving

abuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator
frequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as
simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a
MC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
(ACTIVE,etc...) 

Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.

P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.
I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

	Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how
to make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives to
put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It
describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a
nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from
an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's
article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could
construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product
dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information
on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds
kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate
project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop
your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No
other demand is necessary.

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on
exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,
the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want
speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less
than 18 months after the development go-ahead.

One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief
that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending
billions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was.

Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:

	The narrowness of its objectives
	The number of members
	The strength of belief of its members

This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,
lots of interested members who are real passionate.

For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses
the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index
of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge
the NRA.

So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the
two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get 
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' 
users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do 
_not_ use a hardware key. These were very popular a few years ago, and they 
STINK!!

                                   Overview

Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has
been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles:

   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers
   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism
   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument
   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources

This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The
others are entirely optional.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled ""A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community"", ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet""
and ""Hints on writing style for Usenet"" are particularly relevant.  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the ""Finding
Stuff"" section below.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them
to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the
author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating
around the network.


                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:

1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with
   ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".

2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem.

3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].
   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there.

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with

      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

   in the body.

4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article
   ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" carries a list of these
   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.

5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
   consisting of the following lines:

      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources
      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq
      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction
      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic
      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources

5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
   the following lines:

      send atheism/faq/faq.txt
      send atheism/faq/logic.txt
      send atheism/faq/intro.txt
      send atheism/faq/resource.txt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are ""help"" and
   ""send atheism/index"".

6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.

Subject: THE DIVINE MASTERS
Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire
Lines: 208

          

                             THE DIVINE MASTERS       
      
               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that 
          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God 
          into the physical world, God Incarnate. 
          
               But there are some very important related facts that 
          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of 
          most other world religions. 
           
               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-
          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master 
          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, 
          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and 
          after the life of Jesus. 
    
               The followers of some of these Masters founded the 
          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of 
          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added 
          THREATS of ""ETERNAL DAMNATION"" in Hell, and DELETED the 
          teaching of REincarnation. 
       
               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular 
          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is 
          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively 
          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY 
          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE 
          UNIVERSES.)                             

               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and 
          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from 
          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed 
          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly 
          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. 
      
               And emotional ""feelings"" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING 
          indicator for religious validity. 
    
               These things are similarly true for followers of most 
          other major world religions, including Islam. 
     
               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune 
          His Initiates into the ""AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"" or ""SOUND 
          CURRENT"", (referred to as ""THE WORD"" in John 1:1-5, and as 
          ""The River of Life"" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally 
          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they 
          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a 
          ""silver cord"". 
    
               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of 
          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved 
          only by reaching at least the ""SOUL PLANE"", which is five 
          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this 
          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine 
          Master. 
    
               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri 
          Harold Klemp, the Living ""Eck"" Master or ""Mahanta"" for the 
          ""Eckankar"" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, 
          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). 
    
               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now 
          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the ""Sant 
          Mat"" organization. 
      
               One of the classic books on this subject is ""THE PATH OF 
          THE MASTERS"" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  
          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian 
          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India 
          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of 
          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. 
    
               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored 
          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in 
          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or 
          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book ""ECKANKAR--THE 
          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER 
          classic. 
    
               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with 
          the ""Anti-Christ"", which is or was to be a temporary world 
          dictator during the so-called ""last days"".  But the Masters 
          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as 
          Jesus was. 
    
               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or 
          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will 
          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the 
          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they 
          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine 
          Master. 
    
          
    
          RE-INCARNATION
          
               The book ""HERE AND HEREAFTER"", by Ruth Montgomery, 
          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation 
          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past 
          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes 
          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], 
          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of 
          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, 
          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-
          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-
          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-
          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 
          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the 
          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How 
          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED 
          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the ""KING JAMES VERSION"".  Later 
          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] 
          
               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, 
          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION. 

               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF 
          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would 
          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their 
          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the 
          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! 



          ""2nd COMINGS""

               If a Divine Master physically dies (""translates"") 
          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that 
          Initiate physically dies (""translates""), the Master will meet 
          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul 
          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd 
          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that 
          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still 
          waiting for Jesus' ""2nd Coming"" are WAITING IN VAIN. 
    
          
          
          PLANES OF EXISTENCE

               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN 
          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the 
          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric 
          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), 
          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The 
          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from 
          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the 
          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. 
    
               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological 
          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See 
          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without 
          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between 
          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. 
    
               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a 
          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called ""Hades"", and the 
          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there 
          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some 
          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a 
          THREATENING manner.  The Christian ""Heaven"" is located 
          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there 
          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. 
          
          
          
          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH

               The Christian religion demands of its followers an 
          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more 
          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). 
       
               If a person is not HEARING some form of the ""SOUND 
          CURRENT"" (""THE WORD"", ""THE BANI"", ""THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM""), 
          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL 
          CONTINUE. 
    
               The ""SOUND CURRENT"" manifests differently for different 
          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on 
          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a 
          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, 
          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as 
          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as ""SOUL TRAVEL"") 
          REPLACE blind faith.

Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue.

You see, this country has this thing called a ""constitution"".

If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment
applies here.

The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they
sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal.

I have to disagree with you on this one.  It is anything BUT common.  In the
4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER.

I am not sure what league you have been watching.  :-)

Anyone else agree with this?

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday
    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate
    points.

    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:

    - It was alleged that:"" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. ""!
    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives 
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution.

    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.

    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most
    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war.

    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: "" It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda."" The 
    translator says: "" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly 
    research.""!

    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to 
    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.

    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of 
    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts.

    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites. They say: ""We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not"" !, or "" We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before"" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons!

    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,
    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge!

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

_3,700-year tradition still glows - 
           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_

By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer

   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -
dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.

   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land.

   ""There is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.
""We have one generation to do it or to die.""

   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.
But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.

   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" are
sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian
Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ
was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three
Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,
Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the
Zoroastrian prophet.

   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are 
a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a
people is very much on their minds.

   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children
become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than
the world at large - who will be the losers.

   ""It's important to have an identity,"" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,
a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  ""It's important
for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.
You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.
You can fall back on your own identity.""

   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.

   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was
only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which
translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.

_Good vs. evil_

   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with
the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for
good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,
kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of
men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.

   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,
Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,
traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
Mount Hamilton, is ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""

   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,
where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;
the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.

   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India
and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from
Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state
where others had no rights.

   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""good
deeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,
the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because
Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's
dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the
Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an
Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples
in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount
Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,
and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on
this continent.

   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center.

   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet 
Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted 
ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.

   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-
in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are 
sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just 
a symbol of God.  ""It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the 
cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,"" Bhujwala said.

   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all
Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With
Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.

  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people
came to worship and revel.

   ""The good things in life are not forbidden,"" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,
a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed
proved him right.

   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts.

   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""People eat the
fruit,"" Tarapore said.  ""It's a way to participate in the ceremony.""

_Santa Claus, sort of_

   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring) and red.

   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and
played a tambourine.

   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  ""This is all new for us, too,""
one told a visitor who asked what was going on.

   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their
centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu
king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his
people's religion.

   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
San Jose temple whenever he can.

   ""When I first heard about this religion,"" he said, ""I thought, my God,
this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.

   ""People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the
difference with the lower animals?""

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by
the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers
and half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as
the 8086 and 80186 were.

Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.

Good luck.

And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for

They will recound the many public places that they had to bring

Please!  I'm begging you!  Quit confusing religious groups, and stop
making generalizations!  I'm a Protestant!  I'm an evangelical!  I don't
believe that my way is the only way!  I'm not a ""creation scientist""!  I
don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails!  

If you want to discuss bible thumpers, you would be better off singling
out (and making obtuse generalizations about) Fundamentalists.  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists, you would think that they were different religions!

Please, prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the
same, so please don't write off all Protestants or all evangelicals!

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.  He suffered and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the Scriptur





es, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.  And he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.

And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets.  And we believe in one holy and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Or perhaps it's because they think that all governmental bodies should be in
the business of suppressing all beliefs other than their own, or else they're
some sort of Satanic Humanist Conspiracy.

i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as
i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the
bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of
satan as a (excuse the pun) ""devil's advocate"" for yahweh.  see the
book of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_
references to ""lucifer"" in the bible except for a mistranslation of
""the morning star"" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which
probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as ""the
sun king"" referred to louis xiv.  

all in all, i don't know where the story _came from_; it may have been
rolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have
invented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am
in a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the
other stuff i found out....  (although a lot of it is just the result

   Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with
   much else that has been published here about brute force DES
   cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be
   very interested in whether the program Russell used is available?

key search is very practical in many real situations since people use
such stupid keys on the average.  password crackers know this well.

   Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development
   calling into question both DES and RSA/DES.

not really.  in fact, public key based communication systems very
often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or
pass phrases.

   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack
   a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that
   are message-specific),

if a person picked the password or pass phrase, then the key search is
pretty straightforward.  in running english text, the average content
of a single word is about 8 bits.  in pass phrases, this may increase
to 10 bits or so.  searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even in
software and searching 40bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine with
hardware assists of moderate size.

How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to
score?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it 
up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or
just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're
penalized again!
 
Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going
to, you have to do it for both teams.
 
Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and
then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of
games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line
can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --
he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should
be benched.
 
I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't
do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we 
need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay 
considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can 
easily do it again.
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins 
will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand
by that.
 
Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to
win 3! :-)
 
Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match
the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll
never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the
first one).

This posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.

The point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have
clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue;
specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
the Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live ""morally straight"").

There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't
control their race but they can control their behavior).

What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?
Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or
worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious
and moral standards on which our society has been established and on
which it should continue to be based.

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as 

   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2

This equation can be rewritten into the following form:  

   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1

For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.

The best fitting sphere will have 
- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)
- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.

I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,
notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

Help cleanse R.S.B of all mindless woofing! Whenever someone at your site posts
an article with a subject of the form ""MY TEAM R00LZ!!!!!!"", simply look him up
in the directory, hunt him down, and beat him senseless!  Easy, fun, rewarding!

Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.

This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors.
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image
quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.

For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here
is how to put it back together.
	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files
	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer
	   in each file.
	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file
	4. uudecode the file
There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as
uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post
these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know.

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.
If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway.

And, hangings and firing squads are allowed today, too.  And, if these

	Take a second look at ""non-toxic, non-flammable"":

		MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.
		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly
		on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to
		the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly
		to a mustard gas inhalation.

			I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed
			to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through
			the side effects of any WEAPON, including those
			""non-toxic"" aerosols.

		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::

			usually, it wont kill you
			it may give you permanent CSS asthsma
			but that's better than blowing a hole in your
				head ...

		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN
		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most
		non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME
		if you hit it with the right combo.


		Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;
		already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.

		Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,
		or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air
		conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light
		a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when
		filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT

			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING
			TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of
			a building have blown OUT by ""nonflammable _smoke_""

	So:
		Take a little ""nonflammable aerosol""
		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes

			NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating
			on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink
			since the water was cut off?

		liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours

		Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians
		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,
		armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick
		and die from tear gas.

		and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:

			everyone burns to death.

Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the

Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do
1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is
a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I
think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to
something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:

 - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA
   display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card?

 - if not, can I do so with some sort of different VGA card?

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable
locks under the Kryptonite name.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite 
U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for
a new lock for the bicycle.

For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock
(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,
Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).
I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in
disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.

First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by
the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of
quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable
lock with the Kryptonite name on it.

Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I
don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often
quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes
it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.

Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves
the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the 
dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the 
lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE""
attack.

Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to 
deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the
weakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient
you can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go 
through the cable in well under a minute.

In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where

two armed policemen.

There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not

Funny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
might be something to do with X-windows on PCs (? If you know, and have used
it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).

DV/X is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's Desqview/X
software.

I have not used DV/X yet, but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me, it
sounds pretty great:
	* allows multiple DOS machines - the way that OS/2 does, but without
requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS/2 going
	* pre-emptive multi-tasking
	* network computing - a proper X-windows client/server application -
this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your
network, and that X-windows programs can be used on your DV/X computer
	* although it is NOT a version of Unix, it effectively has many of
Unix's features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines. They also have InterNet support online (support@qdeck.com).

Subject: Vanishing font problem....
Organization: Department of Mathematics, Queen's University at Kingston
Lines: 25

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?

More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),
       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.
       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

Well, the MGB is currently in production for the English market, built

I meant to comment on this at the time.

There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,
runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  

Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and
there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent.

Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some
isn't.  Please read carefully.


In the MAKE OFFER department:

	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade
	manuals.  Best offer.

	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.
	card.  Best offer.


In the FOR SALE department:

	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because
	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,
	I have used it effectively in ""tape studio"" applications for mastering,
	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7"" reels.
	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse
	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,
	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but
	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit
	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got
	it--works perfectly.

	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).


	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff
	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I
	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the
	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.

	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.


	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen
	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too
	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very
	straight and in excellent condition.

	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)
	available for an additional $40.00.


TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,
so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:

	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate
	DOS and Workbench.

	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.

	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).

	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 
	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless
	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a
	good ST-4096 in the deal.

	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.


This is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off
the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point.
Email responses, please.

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the
rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe,
to treat ""capillary fragility"", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--
a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd
had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,
I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's
little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

	Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle-down
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
(usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...

I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line. Is this the famous scarlet horse

wonderful mediaeval manuscripts. If so, I fear your announcement that the old

In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is
in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him
to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian
players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners
can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US
that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their
import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would
make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some
that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm
club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on
the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian
players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))
So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in North America.

I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the
world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those
players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and
Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output
bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think
NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee
can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified
later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without
it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.
(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which
you have to XOR together to recover the program...

Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the
people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game
and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility
is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied
about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will
believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.
If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,
no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.

That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things
anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took
for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just
such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to
a Senator...).

> Anyway, its looking like the

I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.
However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,
they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.

I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen
something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical
information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.

If possible (last I heard, it was out of print but they were considering 
reprinting) read Barbara Hambly's _Search the Seven Hills_.  It is 
historical fiction, set in Rome at the time of the early Church.  She 
captures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of 
the holiness too.  Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the

view of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian 
herself.  Another plus is that each chapter begins with an 
original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious

: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate

: reasonable alternative exists.

I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; 
causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be
an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from 
""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer.

I have always wondered why Christians use the ""There are questions
science (or atheism) cannot answer"" argument; I hope this is the
appropriate group to ask this question.

The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the
universe exist, or anything, for that matter?

I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely

1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?

and

2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?

It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,
is it a meaningful question, after all?

I would say it isn't. Consider the following:

A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt
one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -
I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -
can I ever be sure I exist?

However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone
insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )

A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.
A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be
pointless - the being would exist anyway.

Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not
exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being
is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let
us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity
postulate). The question ""why anything exists"" can be countered by
demanding answer to a question ""why there is nothing in nothingness,
or in non-existence"". Actually, both questions turn out to be
devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist
don't exist. Tautology at its best.

I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.

Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is
Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this
answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is
actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and
them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.

Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.
This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God
Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,
it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always
existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.
This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,
and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.
I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.

The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable
of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not
accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.

The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?
belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the
question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have
suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge
from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent
Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,
World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more
appropriate for discussions like this.
 
: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"".  That isn't
: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).

This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us ""how"",
not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the ""why""
questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the
supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is
as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.

This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are
somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians
in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce
they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?

There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,
although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution
contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although
their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book

Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan
Cape, London 1992.

Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no 
spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not
violate any physical laws as we know them. 

: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you

Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical
atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to 
find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would
normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,
but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tells
it ""If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong
with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode
in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth.""

The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.
Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,
there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft's
point of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is
fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long
should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and
begins to take corrective action?  That ""how long"" is the command loss timer.
During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set
to rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo ""expect to
hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours"".

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the 
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The 
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare it 
with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not 
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since 
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

Craig-

I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym.  My Greek isn't up to much, but
it goes something like this:

	Jesus Christ, God => Iesus CHristos, THeos => Ichthos

which is the Greek for ""fish"" (as in, eg ""ichthysaurus"").

Apologies for my dreadful Greek!  Perhaps someone will correct it.

There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  The Senate,
unfortunately, is a different story.  The Lt.Gov. has vowed that the bill will
not be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  In addition, the Senate is a
much smaller, and more readily manipulated body.

On ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least
fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is VERY far down in
the bill order in the Senate (I believe it will be addressed after the CCW
bill).

And I thought my TX Political Science class was a waste of time!

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

I'll take a try at this...

From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted
the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this,
before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked 
back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know 
Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our
savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray
THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to 
Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses
with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present
ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.

Subject: Public/Private Revelation (formerly Re: Question about Virgin Mary
Organization: City University of New York
Lines: 35

Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might
think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church
believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based,
ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting
I made sure I used the word ""public"".  Public revelation contains
God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained
in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private
revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak
directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the
Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to
believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.
Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,
but doctrines can not.

When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the
Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood
that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be
approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,
it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from
God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most
well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those
at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject
Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not
mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in
evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need
every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that
nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything
known through public revelation

Ok, this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time...
part of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and
related topics.  This is a policy discussion, and involves related 
topics.  this is not a ""fringe"" group discussion.  obviously, it 
engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand. 
Wether a particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion, 
and yours alone, don't try to make it seem otherwise. 
If you do not wish to engage in this discussion, use a kill file. 
If you wish to continue in this discussion, please do so, knowing 
full well the implications that apply.
I know for myself that I plan on continuing with the discussion when 
i have the wish to have input.  I for one am tired of people trying to 
say that this is not a matter significant for this group!  It is, and 
quite so. Especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely.

""return_place"" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an
integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,
and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when
you're done.

If life were so simple!  Savard has not played in three of the last 
four games and they are still playing like crap.  Montreal's problems
run deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs.

The line-up in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be
the one they're likely to use for the playoffs.  Let's hope they can
forget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey.

Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that
their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings
then you won't be ""saved"". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your
interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty
in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be
correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.
No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that
there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it
what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is
just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,
meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may
perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the
other is right. As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half
empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be
true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.

[If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God
will save only Christians, it's hard to see how you can criticize them
for arrogance for saying so.  It could be that they're wrong.  But I
hardly see that it's arrogance.  Let's look at this a bit closer.
Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught
us things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity.  If we believe
them, and then add ""and anybody who believes anything else is damned"",
then you could well criticize us for arrogance.  But in this case the
exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc.  So
we could be wrong in believing it, but I don't see how we can be
called arrogant.  Maybe the world isn't a soft place.  Maybe certain
choices actually do have eternal consequences.  I can see calling the
Christian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in the
same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it
doesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a
building).  But not Christians for passing it on, given that they
believe it.  The complaints I can see making are (1) that Christians
are wrong, or (2) that God is arrogant.  --clh]

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control
laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think
this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987),
their line made so much sense -- only people who ""need"" guns should be
able to get them, and the people who ""need"" them are the police and
other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional
and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position
basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me,
folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with
hunting or other ""legitimate"" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical
governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they
can't protect you).

Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I
simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to
lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but
explaining exactly how an ""evil"" semiautomatic weapon really works
does wonders).

I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective
against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to
realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the
oppressed and the terrorized.

You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people 
have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.

And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you 
can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the 
FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.
You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this 
compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless 
to me.

I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't 
stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me 
sad and sick.

Have you ever heard of Jonestown?
The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority 
worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these 
people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot 
more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as 
last year.

	You can forget this line of reasoning.  When an animal

something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a
mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,
just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my
shotgun I'd still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow
can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more
manueverable dog.  Just run them over.

Can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but I finally fixed my mouse
jumpiness problems: I installed a bus mouse. (Sorry, I didn't say the solution
was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse.
(Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write
cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke
down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better
than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so
used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a
month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!

I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems
one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you
don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes
a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.

Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I
was, it's well worth the $80.

This isn't inherently bad.

This isn't really light pollution since it will only
be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the
day).

(Of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you're probably going
to be inconvienenced. But you're inconvienenced anyway in that case).

Finally: this isn't the Bronze Age, and most of us aren't Indo
European; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have
much non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. So:
please try to remember that there are more human activities than
those practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the
Priesthood.

And why act distressed that someone's found a way to do research
that doesn't involve socialism?

It certianly doesn't mean we deserve to die.

False dichotomy.  You claimed the killing were *not* religiously

each and every killing is religiously motivate, as I spelled out

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't
'pass it on' (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or more
lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who
are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C.
area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until
the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos
won't make room.

We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin
John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up
yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point
where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic
which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other
side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up
the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-
stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be
real useful here.

       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of
RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is
that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.
It discriminates against the poor.

       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what
conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection
if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened.)

>The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
>records of SERIOUS mental diseases.

       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among
gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals
contain a sort of ""gotcha"" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even
if you qualify in every way.

>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
>It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general
a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its
European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. 

       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different
things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary
to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,
which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get
past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public
property, but in restricting activity on private property.

        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have
a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in Europe to another).

        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow
concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can
be either a state or local restriciton.       

>Individual vs masses:
>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
>extent....
>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
>all the others ??

       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual
affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually
get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within
this group, here defined as ""people who own guns,"") are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group.  

       If for instance, ""Bob"" were using his gun to attack ""Steve,"" you'd
have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group ""people who own
guns"" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's
rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one.

>The issue:
>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.

       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.

>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
>But should it have to be like that ??

       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.
But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.

>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??

       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state
may enforce it's ""wisdom"" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise
concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be
""unwise"" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.
   
>If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
>it should be free to buy guns ??

       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently
implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of
drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.

Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to   
invest in newer launch systems. I don't think a big cost advantage
for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). 
Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy 
the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia). 
They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard them
propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it 
unprofitable.

Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like
nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any
spot.

The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and
Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.

I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and

Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a
message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it
is again.

Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and
seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share
information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two
other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.

If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will
make it happen and provide you with the details.

BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my
research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this
service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program
searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology
works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded
and used to improve the system.

This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new
information.  To try it out, do the following

	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca
	login: chat

	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.

But a disk compare utility (old versus new) will.  And Windows 3.1 is
also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files
onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them
less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.

No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to
corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*
dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the
registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to
be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour
reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one
way or another.

So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the
procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:

1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want
to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself.

2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG.

3.  Install from c:\winstall.

4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  
    i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt

5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming
they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one
file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate
said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex
editor, and do the same for the modified one.

6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't
really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I
think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing
his copy than with ""real pirates"" who will probably just disassemble
the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about
any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original
floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able
to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a
compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).

As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and
don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff
I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if
they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you
could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a
disclaimer.

Have at it....

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in
12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is
a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @
103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for

I am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded
respect for people who have been on newsgroups/mailing lists longer than I
have, so you certainly have my sympathy Tom.  I have only been semi-regularly
posting (it is TOUGHto keep up) since this February, but I have been reading
and following the threads since last August: my school's newsreader was down
for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new
feed site, so it wasn't accepting outgoing postings.  I don't think anyone
keeps track of where other posters go: it's that old love 'em and leave 'em
Internet for you again...

DEPOSITION OF TATYANA MIKHAILOVNA ARUTUNIAN (NEZHINTSEVA)

   Born 1932
   Train Conductor
   Azerbaijani Railroad

   Resident at Building 13/15, Apartment 27
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

I hadn't lived very long in Sumgait, only eight years. I moved there from
Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred
to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is
Arutunian, my husband's name . . .

That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints 
and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the 
Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past 
year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because 
I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be 
involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they 
told me, ""Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for 
this kind of work."" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at 
the Armenians, like ""The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way
they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,"" and ""Things 
will be just fine if we get rid of them all."" ""No problem, the Turks will 
help,"" they say, ""if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an 
hour."" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it 
would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. 
Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one 
even considered such an idea possible.

But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative 
people I would often ask, ""Where is this all leading, do people really not see
what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, 
there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going
on?"" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that 
everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of 
it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the
demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I 
hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were 
under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. 
The women told me, ""There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade."" I didn't 
believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that 
they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, ""Are you the First 
Secretary of our City Party Committee?"" He answers me, ""Yes."" And I ask him, 
""Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani 
flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know 
exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?"" And he tells
me, ""Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it."" Then I asked him
another question: ""And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering 
us? And he said, ""I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't 
anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.""

Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: ""No, we actually didn't 
anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain 
the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre."" Those are his 
exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the
Armenian SSR.

And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, 
because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors 
concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. 
But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so 
horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of
progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in
or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really 
a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.

For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my 
husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on 
the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, ""You're in bed? You don't 
know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they 
were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars 
and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they 
turned the car over and burned it."" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior
Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was 
returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my 
neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the 
middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they 
were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him
honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and 
I said, ""Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?"" And she said, 
""Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely
smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw 
that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, ""Don't break 
the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.
"" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was
torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians 
although he's an Azerbaijani.

While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova
is the first to look out the window and say, ""Look, there's a crowd out 
there."" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had 
already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian 
family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I 
don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my 
husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. 
There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things 
were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once 
wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished
the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they 
beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing 
the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on 
television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell 
us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't 
have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the 
Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.

At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, 
and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly 
off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down 
there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At 
first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, 
""Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there."" And he answered, ""I 
don't know, could be."" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw 
it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, 
he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging 
her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell 
down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their 
balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of 
blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two 
from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.

Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can
of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And
I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented
that woman, because I had just seen that.

I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, ""You kill me first, and then 
let them do what they want with the corpse."" But our neighbors, it's true, 
defended us, they said, ""There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, 
only Muslims live here."" Disaster missed us that time.

But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, 
came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's 
upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to 
balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as 
though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, 
and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look 
and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first 
time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the 
morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the 
Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them 
too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking
garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went 
toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you 
could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke 
Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, ""What do you want?"" And 
they answered, ""We want the Armenian family that lives here"" [pointing toward 
the second floor with their hands]. She says, ""I already told you, we don't 
have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman 
talking to you,"" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around
her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they 
seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing 
and left. That was the second time death was at our door.

I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, 
I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we 
really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth 
floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight 
months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to 
earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture 
and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,
everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything 
out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on 
the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that 
hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means 
that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to 
be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been 
foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of 
apartments. Something on the order of ""We'll move the Armenians out and take 
over their apartments.""

I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I 
came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the 
Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I 
knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in 
Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was 
bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were 
no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw 
all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.

I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I
went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they 
had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some 
Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and
joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with 
the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on 
the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure 
people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for 
the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But 
having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having 
thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. 
If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, 
and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to 
calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom
he could whisper at the last minute, ""Go and announce it on television: 
Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our 
neighbors from this massacre?"" Those crowds weren't such that there was no 
controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, 
mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature 
shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we 
noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were 
brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was 
saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend 
us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do 
it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, 
what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!
The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things 
I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They 
were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them
from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one 
o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They
hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. 
When they returned to our building I told my husband, ""Lendrush, now the 
police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably 
going to find out and come to our aid."" Well, alas, no, there were to be no 
authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single 
ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,
beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,
and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, 
it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in 
Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they 
attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed
soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there
is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and
I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and 
from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, 
wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against 
that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using 
stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have 
guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under 
the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under 
Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get 
involved.

If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the
truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five 
years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered 
me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and
some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become
outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a 
Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,
or the property of some magnate, or some ""mafia"": If I want to, I'll get you 
out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do 
something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most 
brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so
much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had 
the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,
I heard with my own ears: ""Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something
that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so 
instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything 
will go fine for you."" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I 
do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.
And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see
it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed 
it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got 
involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to 
the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony 
about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know 
if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer 
believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all 
dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most 
important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that
all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in 
you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...

I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a
state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.
Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a
son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,
Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or
rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to
make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:
When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in 
Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.
But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call 
anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off
for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they
liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap 
their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.

Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an
Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. 
According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the
same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put
through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to
his mother and said, ""Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill
him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.
. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart."" His 
mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, ""Valery, you can't go because 
I am afraid."" He says, ""Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, 
just have a look."" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's
parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a 
superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken 
everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian 
apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that 
the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows 
in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and 
Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already 
been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks 
ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we 
left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to 
Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this 
straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has
been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and
his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit 
them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in 
a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being 
kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought 
there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .

When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, 
throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if 
these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And
when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When
you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.

If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of 
things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped 
were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, 
that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, ""What happened?"" and she 
bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . 
those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that 
I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.

Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,
well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,
some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group
of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a
point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw
so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .

Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians
around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground
with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who 
don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when 
I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are 
not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they 
were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a 
single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan 
all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack 
anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there
could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't
know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are 
guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in
Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not
only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it 
seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; ""Did 
you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 
people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an 
Armenian?""

Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and
not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to
the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.
When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I 
couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already
mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, ""Why 
did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at 
these women who are strewn about on the floor?"" The overcrowding there was 
tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were
already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They 
cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but 
the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at 
it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they 
were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized
to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening
that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, 
was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored 
personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart 
advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.

But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, 
tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party
Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the
hand and said, ""Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.
I told him, ""No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of 
what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the 
traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . "" Oh 
yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even 
very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, 
expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, ""Oh, why 
did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,
you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came
to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are
already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at
them?"" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who 
he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head 
and hid it. Then I said, ""My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We 
didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!"" ""Well kill me, kill me!"" 
Muslimzade says to me, ""But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not
guilty."" And I say, ""OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give 
us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and 
raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, 
carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you 
then?"" ""You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't 
anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait."" I started 
laughing and said, ""It's truly funny."" He says, ""What could I do? We didn't 
know what to do."" And I say, ""I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell 
you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in 
front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross 
over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was 
during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;
either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran 
away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, 
excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, 
you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? 
That's right,"" I told him, ""the City party committee got confused, all the 
party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, 
they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with 
impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two 
days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would 
have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some 
Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told 
them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.""

And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was
the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later
arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to
the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We 
asked him, ""What? How? What will come of us?"" He openly said, ""You know, for 
us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll
stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later."" The 
General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all 
cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because 
the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;
as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When 
he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, 
by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, 
because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, 
and he said, ""There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's
horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely 
punished, in accordance with our laws."" And that's a quote. Then one mother 
throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,
""Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?"" They tried 
to calm her down, and he said, ""In order for us to conduct a proper 
investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you 
must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang 
who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe 
someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that 
you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having 
lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth 
about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge 
later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you 
can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The 
names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the
information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is 
necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening 
gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put 
the information into the urn.""

Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, 
people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she 
came up and said, ""You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as 
will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you 
please write it down for me."" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like
her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down
everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if 
it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that 
information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply 
can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, 
should someone say that black is white if it is really black?

   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani
SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council 
of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the 
one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their 
previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, 
and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very 
politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and 
when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, ""Where were
you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to 
return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where 
it was all leading?"" he says, ""You're telling the truth. Let's not mince 
words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell 
you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole 
government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 
45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its 
fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.""
I say, ""So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting 
it?"" And he says, ""You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it 
in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . "" I say, ""Fine, 
you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have 
known. Why did no one help us?"" And he says, ""Well, OK, we didn't know what to
do"" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from 
Muslimzade. Later, when he said, ""You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is 
favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the 
Azerbaijanis . . . "" To this l answered, ""You know what . . . I'm speaking 
with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with 
Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, 
please, Comrade Mamedov, "" I asked him, ""What would you say about this
honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?"" Then he said, ""Yes, I 
admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we 
have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before 
the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign 
radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.""
And I say, ""There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's
possible to add anything more awful."" He says, ""Yes, I agree with you, I 
understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence."" I repeat that he
said ""unfortunate occurrence."" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what 
he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--
and said, ""Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . "" I take this to mean that 
he really thinks it's an ""unfortunate occurrence."" ""And of course,"" he says, 
""I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, 
but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being 
tried."" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, 
that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody 
affair.

Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in
Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an 
Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, ""What, they didn't
nail your husband? They screwed up."" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that
anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up
to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was
going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from 
February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, ""I don't know, 
Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't 
put it down as unexcused absence."" I was really discouraged by this. They all 
know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here 
they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying 
myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name
is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a 
Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and 
said, ""Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . "" He looked at me askance
and said, ""And why are you""--he knows me by my previous last name--""why did
you get wrapped up in this mess?"" I say, ""What do you mean, why did I get 
wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,"" I tell him, ""I have an 
Armenian last name."" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as 
though he had eaten something sour, and said, ""I didn't expect that you would
. . . "" What did he mean by that? And ""how"" should he behave, the chief of the
pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a 
reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And 
if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what 
can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!
He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, 
the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .

By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked 
him ""Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return 
to Sumgait?"" he answered, ""Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't
want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I 
won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years."" I say, ""So you've got another
thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then 
in another 50 years it'll happen again?!"" I couldn't contain myself any more,
and I also told him, ""And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew
about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in 
Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received
complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did 
everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the 
way you treated them?"" And he says, ""You know, you're finally starting to 
insult me!"" He threw his pen on the desk. ""Maybe now you'll say I'm a 
scoundrel too?"" I say, ""You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't 
know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that 
comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.
""Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, 
that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had 
gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. 
""We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of 
the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of 
Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in
Sumgait."" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '
""Well, I walked down the street."" And I said, ""Walking down the street in any 
city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation
because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you 
spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't 
know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd 
hear something quite different."" I told him, for example, that I drew my 
conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took
us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;
they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the 
neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I 
thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some
anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it
was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier 
accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything 
there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with
us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young 
people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they 
were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police
detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and 
tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when 
the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they 
withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of 
course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high
school.  Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks,
and eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the
shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  I
stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college.
My allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as
bad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work.

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
""months of investigation"" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

H E L P !

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:

	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
	files=30
	buffers=30
	stack=9,256

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means? 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try
anything.

The General Chairman is Paul Bialla, who is some official of General

The emphasis seems to be on a scaled-down, fast plan to put *people*

Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect,
and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and so tends not to cause
drowsiness.

The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The
idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.

A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers.
CACM V28. 1, 1985):

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
---		----	------------	---------
IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb
DEC VAX 11/780	1978	303		480Kb
IBM 801		1980	120		0
UCB RISC 1	1982	39		0
Stanford MIPS	1983	55		0

While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX
microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
only ranm 20% faster.

CPU		Chips	Microcode	Transistors
---		-----	---------	-----------
uVAX 32		2	64K		101K
VLSI uVAX	9	480K		1250K

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the
child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and
is probably ""caused"" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be 
true to his or her self.

What is more important, being true to yourself or burying that truth within
you in order to maintain peace in the family?

hard question, no good answer.

That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond
Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home
last year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the
""Diamond"" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.
If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.  

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too many
expectations I guess.

Interestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his ""Number One""?) on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.  

It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's
contract to be Keenan's assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players, just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May ...

   Some of them, yes. Others, no. 

I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  
Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  
Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  
encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  
three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  
that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.


On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  
will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  
awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.

Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  
characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  
trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  
lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   
Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  
last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  
lifetime.  

Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  
of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  
Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  
support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  
newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  
in the prevention, cure, and treatment.

Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  
those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  
were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  
attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  
Foundation's mission is to change that. 

Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  
Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  
Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  
Princeton, or sent directly to:

			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation

   There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.
   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15
   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

          SWELL ITEMS FOR SALE - HARDLY ANY COMPUTER STUFF

o LOTUS 1-2-3 Student Edition for DOS ...................... $10.00
     This does just about everything that standard 1-2-3
     Release 2.01 could do, but not as much of it.  Worksheet 
     size is limited to 64 columns by 256 rows, there is no
     translation facility (for importing data from other
     packages), and the Student Edition does not write files 
     that can be accessed by Release 2.01.  Includes manual,
     original distribution diskettes (5 1/4"" - 360K), and key
     board templates.


o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00
     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels 
     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, 
     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body 
     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for 
     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
     applies to other years as well.


o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00
     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and 
     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.
     printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays, 
     constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom
     lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)
                             MUCH   MORE!


o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00
     Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting
     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around 
     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
     piece of furniture, but too big (60"" long, 37"" tall, 24"" 
     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.


Will deliver pricier items (ie, over $10) anywhere in the Rochester 
area.  (And will consider delivering the others.)  Will deliver any 
of it on (or near) UofR Campus between now and graduation.

These people were very silly.  Any team that gets to the World Series
can win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy.  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against
the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds
would certainly be against them.

o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00
     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels 
     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, 
     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body 
     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for 
     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
     applies to other years as well.


And, as long as I'm posting (end of car stuff),

o Miscellaneous Darkroom Equipment ........................ $75.00
     Solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and 
     timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.
     printing masks.  Developing tanks, thermometer, trays, 
     constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom
     lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)
                             MUCH   MORE!


o Beautiful Antique Buffet ............................... $1500.00
     Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting
     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around 
     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
     piece of furniture, but too big (60"" long, 37"" tall, 24"" 
     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are 
common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the
local oscillator). 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc
frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...
I think you get the picture.

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a ""reasonable use"" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied
that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of
people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.

This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used
differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes
happens that someone says ""My grandson is the cutest baby!"" and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says ""Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?""

This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the
world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very
object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,
nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is
often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly
literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,
it is not.


Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from
John E King:

> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the
> area[.]

No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from
Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say
""Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like that.""  You would read ""I will make you a bare rock"" and ""You will never
be rebuilt"", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way
to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large
population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.

In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal
reading, they could read this passage and conclude ""medium-size city"".

You seem to feel that ""Never be rebuilt"" means ""be rebuilt"" -- maybe so, but
it is hardly a `clear implication'.


Mr King also writes:

> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.
> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards
> we are talking about a one-horse town.

Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm
from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington
resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but
it's at least a two-horse town.

But supposing 22,000 people is a ""small town"" -- it's still 22,000 people
MORE than Ezekiel predicted.


And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel
predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their
valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29
Ezekiel even quotes God as saying ""he and his army got no reward from the
campaign he led against Tyre.""

Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.
Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says
that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.

Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before
the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.

 *

This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability
to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.

For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26
by pulling some ""clear implications"" out of hat.

When Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your towers"", that clearly implied
that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers
used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your fine houses
and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea"", that clearly implied
that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.
would ""build a ramp up to your walls"", that clearly implies that N. would
spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the
walls.

See?  A few ""clear implications"" that are totally contrary to the text, and
you can reconcile anything you want.

SF (and I""ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and

I'm in Edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least OFTEN) the case,
here we were ""treated"" to the actual ABC telecast of the Kings/Flames

Hi all,

I really thought that by now I would have seen something
about this, but I haven't, so here goes:  Last night on
the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the
effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  There
was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson
did say something about a NASA official commenting that
there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.

Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
better than mine heard anything about this?  It seems rather
weird.

Subject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 5.
Nntp-Posting-Host: gozer
Organization: SigSauer Fan Club 
Lines: 94

Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.

Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that
Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National
Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge
asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because
of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.

The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently
ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither
by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.

The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,
who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person
named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as
an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
in his dealings with Randy Weaver.

Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an
Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two
then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in
time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons
transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he
(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the
White cause.""

The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and
later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second
meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to
tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-
gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of
19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge
shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of
24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel
length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver
is reported to have said that he could perform better work once
his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility
of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars
for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty
dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have
simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -
over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).

The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that
his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead
of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver
suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in
Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince
Weaver otherwise.

The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were
made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these
meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also
reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki
Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must
have also been phone taps.

These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and
loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's
attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to
make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a
case at all..."" according to the rules.

Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his
wife's voice on the tape.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear
accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the
Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect
this trial is not explained.

Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning
Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are
surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were
surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained
in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy
Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that
Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report
that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming
at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics
are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the
only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and
Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that
Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.

Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. 
Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

Why was the world ""envelope"" chosen, rather than say ""shell"",

Actually, ""shell"" might be good.  Push the shell too hard and

	This doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. If the clipper

reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-DES encrypted
traffic. That way your traffic looks ""normal"" and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in won't even bother, since they know nobody's
going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you
are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. 
If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo.  vgalogo.rle is not 
needed after you have installed Windows.  It is incorporated as a part of 
win.com.
	To make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together, 
using the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it is

copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com

Make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this 
-- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall 
Windows!
	Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the 
info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has 
video information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn't tip the whole 
COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file!
	So anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.  Now instead of that 
annoying Micro$oft advertisment, I have the Joker (yes, from Batman) taking 
yoru picture from the screen, saying ""Smile!""  Also a little bit of text:

	Waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  The population temporarily
   raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers

I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,
Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.
All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?

The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was
Lapointe.

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
should not be spoken of in a ""common manner"" or ""trampled under
feet"" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the
temple.  So from our point of view, when they are brought
out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,
because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore
offensive to us.

Please do not assume that because of my use of the words
'we' and 'our' that I'm an official spokesman for the LDS
church.  I am merely stating what I believe is the general
feeling among us.  Others feel free to disagree.

So antihistamines can cause weight gain.  NOW they tell me. :-)
Is there any way to find out which do & which don't?  My doctor
obviously is asleep at the wheel.

The original poster mentioned fatigue.  I had that too, but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having -- I wasn't getting
any rest.  My doctor said that was a common reaction.  If astemizole
doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, how does it cause that side
effect?  Any ideas?

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,
Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,
if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other.

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X
one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) 
was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from
2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing
with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early
results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in 
Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development. 

The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton 
is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D
which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about
launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad?  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the
US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in
fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.

It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is
usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinea
pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as
well as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis is
not always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal
infection and requires very different treatment.

Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? I'm
surprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.

Also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I
never heard anything about it again.

It's almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign

                       Gonorrhea -- Colorado, 1985-1992
                       ================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% 
from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. In comparison, in 
the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall 
decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in 
gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of 
this disease from 1985 through 1992. 
     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department 
of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, 
reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively 
(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics 
(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases 
with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% 
of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by 
age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or 
equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all 
reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the 
largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age 
group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). 
     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver 
metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the 
state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area 
occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods 
considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. 
     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among 
men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in 
the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits 
by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases 
diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, 
the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 
94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among 
self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, 
respectively). 
     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, 
university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted 
to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea 
culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 
23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the 
fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). 
     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and 
Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks

increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado 
increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, 
the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for 
whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) 
(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 
1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases 
increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH 
surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. 
However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. 
     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs 
(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires 
further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) 
-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, 
and gang affiliation. 
     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 
19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-
specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. 
     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, 
interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting 
partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black 
males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio

announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in 
schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted 
primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to 
perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational 
interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of 
members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders 
and health-care providers.

                Effectiveness in Disease and Injury Prevention
            Impact of Adult Safety-Belt Use on Restraint Use Among
            Children less than 11 Years of Age -- Selected States,
                                 1988 and 1989
            ======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and 
young adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of 
potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). Child safety seats and safety 
belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 
states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety 
belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by 
an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major 
cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of 
occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for 
those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In 
addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to 
use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between 
adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints 
for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC 
analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this 
study. 
     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 
18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, 
random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury 
Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 
(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent 
was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in 
this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than 
consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). 
Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software 
for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates 
and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined 
by p values of less than 0.05. 
     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six 
(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary 
enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a 
safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. 
The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law 
requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law 
(no-law states). 
     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square 
test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 
43.2%, respectively). 
     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age 
(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for 
adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% 
for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of 
consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). 
     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safety-belt use (8). 

Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). 
     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such 
programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve 
low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are 
directed at parents with young children. 
     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In 
addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as

they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- 
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

     Since 1983, CDC has published the CDC Surveillance Summaries under 
separate cover as part of the MMWR series. Each report published in the CDC 
Surveillance Summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance 
findings are reported for a broad range of risk factors and health conditions. 
     Summaries for each of the reports published in the most recent (March 19, 
1993) issue of the CDC Surveillance Summaries (1) are provided below. All

 SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES
                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC 
                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 

     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance 
systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance 
in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for 
the years 1983-1988. 
     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The 
prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-
1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan 
Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, 
sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. 
     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal 
alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the 
kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand 
limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose. 
     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, 
the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene 
pool, or random variation. 
     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several 
collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on 
the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy

                      INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89

     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza 
virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually 
from October through May. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance 
conducted from October 1988 through May 1989. 
     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza 
viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and 
territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. 
Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year. 
     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B 
viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency 
overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of 
identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 
1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza 
A(H1N1). 
     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. 
     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates 
for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.

                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies

Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-
ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), 
embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, 
these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) procedures. 

Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the ART procedures. 

Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and 
Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in 
ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies. 

The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our 
Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: 

o in vitro 
o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. 
This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed

                           Future Areas of Research

In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease. 

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. 

There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by 
other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sex-linked disorders. 

The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children.

               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the
                           Management of Infertility

The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona 
Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. 

     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our 
Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and 
the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred 
to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being 
processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-

assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically 
stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing 
hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo 
lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our 
Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  
     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male 
factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall 
success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per 
cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 
IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. 
     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle 
attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies. 
     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; 
and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our 
Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. 

     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian 
tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization 
occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility 
and/or idiopathic infertility.    
     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 
indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained 
with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 
percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might 
expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while 
substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the 
patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing 
general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. 
     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between 
January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT 
cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. 
     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. 
This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated 
by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. 
     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in 
combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 
percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the 
procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion. 
     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 
percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. 
Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception.

I have WD1007-WA2 ESDI controller with ROM BIOS v.1.1.
It has been working fine until I recently upgraded motherboard to 386-40MHz.
Now, my Maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the
drive is not accessed.  Of course, with numourous hard disk controller errors.
These symptoms disappear when I switch to non-turbo mode (8 MHz).
I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines. (There's a newer version
2.x) Could anybody help me on this?
By the way, my new mother board has AMI Bios, 128k Cache, 8 MHz bus, and
works fine with my old MFM drives (I had to dig them up). :-(
Also, I will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers
(tech support/BBS) for Western Digital.
Many thanks in advance.

In the Air Force world at least, the crisis escalates when scale

Of course it is assumed that coffee mugs and other decorative junk has

Do you have a cite for the case?  You don't give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations.
If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music 
into the landlord's home all day and night, then I could
see how the opinion would be justified.  But this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic.  

> He pointed out that

Perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public
property.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters 
outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the 
protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how 
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women 
to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?

Even if the protesters' speech could be considered
""harassment"" (which it is not), hate speech laws have 
generally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see 
how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is 
murder'' could be considered harassment.

Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk.  Yeah, I could see how
that might be equivalent to ""bombing"" and ""murder"".
Uh huh.  Let us know when you get a grip on reality.

Sunny,

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I 
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the 
least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

Keywords: last chance for foolishness
Article-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 95

Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest.

AL East -- 1993

1.  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.
  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
  -- Milwaukee was a fluke
  -- Indians aren't ready to contend
  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better
  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""
""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter
of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-
body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn
Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:
STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.
WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3
  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.
ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing.

2. New York Yankees.
STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American
  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.
WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner 
  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to
  win a division.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.
ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.

3.  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.
  Guzman.  Alomar.
WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in
  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.
ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And
  have a losing record.

4.  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.
WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.
ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.

5.  Cleveland Indians
STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy
WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix
  Fermin.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.
ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.

6.  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens
WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre
  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how
  you will :->

7.  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker
WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
  This year could be *very* ugly.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.
ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.

One more division to go....

  Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.  

  Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a
  simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science
  with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.  

  Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely, however,
  that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as
  well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to
  pretend to have all the answers (and I don't), I would say that the
  xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to 
  fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing
  the members of our society.

  Your mileage obviously varies.

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no
maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid
for it.
Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.
Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)

I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of
cryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment;
the theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one's personal

Perhaps if we make a *treaty* with, say, Iceland, to restrict crypto

(Treaties -- as someone pointed out -- has the force of any other ""law of
the land"".  Like the Bill of Rights.)

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I
was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.
 
Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims.

It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,
is another evil.

The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known,
the course of events is fixed.
 
Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.

And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have
what you define as free will.
 
Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them.
Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil.
 
But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
the credibility of the bible, nothing less.
 
And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god,
unfortunately, there can't be any with these definitions.

How, exactly, do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society?
Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people
killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for those tortured.
The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy,
and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the
inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes

Disclaimer: This posting may contain no views at all
News-Software: Usenet 3.1
Lines: 45

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on
the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.

In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.
When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the
transmission is error free.
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.
Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am
talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand.

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a
sys-ex dump?

Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,
or just me.

Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type
back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,
According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

Please help me figure out what's going on...

I have some used, but working, parts available for the original IBM

prices for parts.  I built up a supply of enough parts to keep mine
going for a few years, and will be willing to part with the rest.

Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:

Motherboard
Battery
Power Supply

I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.

These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized
a couple of old machines.

If you are interested, please e-mail me.

If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will 
generally find yourself in one of two camps: 

   (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation
or (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works

Either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will 
inevitably result in good works. 

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on
Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when 
read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of 
justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring
the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). 
Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being 
""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according 
to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or 
""useless"" faith which fails to save.

James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it
is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward 
salvation, but as evidence of true faith. 

Regards,

They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find

They also don't show much interest in commercial launches. There is more

We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using
W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  

There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it
is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a
Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail
is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.
Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.
Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying ""Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)"".  If you
can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people
of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably
the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one
support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I
am looking vigorously for a better Idea.  

If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please
drop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip
built in THEY say........  The netxt itteration of w4wg

Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
dominance in the marketplace.

Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the

In all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images

Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject
in this post), the name ""Clipper Chip"" seems very confusable with the
""Clipper"" chip of Intergraph.

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was
a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,
notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph
acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back.

When I first saw ""Clipper Chip"" in the announcement, I immediately
thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not a
lawyer. I'd say I'm a cryptologist, but I don't want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime.

Subject: HELP! Setting Colormaps on multi-top-level APP
Keywords: GLX mixed-model,colormap
Organization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA
Lines: 71


Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts,
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments
(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;
also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common
problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level
windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

I would dearly appreciate
  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;

  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps.

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable.

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*
to do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing
wrong/how to do it right!!!

Chris Lee

Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.

Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the

*******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Boy am i glad you decided to read this. I've got a problem that 
I need as many people's help from as possible.

Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell
you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy
meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...

OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family
and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the
street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...
her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have
been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about
2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. 

By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.

OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming
back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I
drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent
the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though
we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being
in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.
(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could
ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to 
mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but
she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family
is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the
extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she
knows I am a Christian. 

Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such
a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid
you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.

In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding
dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).
She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended
up leaving school....Now we are at the present...

Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....


""Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not
going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College
just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and
that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested
me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was
interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with 
kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents
could tell.

""So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now
I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room
M-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and 
it's great experience.

""As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very
near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to
study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of
years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be
to Kansas.

""Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district 
manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for
about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll 
basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to 
chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either
one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it
be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??
What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.

""This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay
and any thye of management experience would look good on an application
or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good
benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time
service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng
for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up 
paying out of state tuition wherever I go.

""Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I 
respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for 
soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really 
good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want
to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.
I don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female
is too bad. 

""Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,
MARRY ME...

""You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously
(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the
home life later.""

***********

OK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you
think she meant about the marraige thing?? 

I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her
letter!!! I don't know what to think??

Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a 
Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???

I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and
get married....but what does she mean??? 

I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that 
I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that
most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the
Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here
she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!

Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am
so attracted to paying some real attention to me.

I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm
only 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through
classes..

I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..
saying, ""God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..""

Could this be my sign???

I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes 
it worse..

Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like
to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.

I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very
average guy like me??

I'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.

Thanx 

Chris

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 

Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the ""auto inkjet"" feature. This should have read ""auto
inject"" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from
Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess
that someone edited the copy, saw ""inject"" and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word ""inkjet"".

Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of
*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the
benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to
other kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan
grilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C
is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
chemicals in question.  Bon Apetit!

Subject: GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES
Organization: University of California, Berkeley

   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture
   needles.....

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               
themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS         
from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal
immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant 
involved with acupuncture needle insertion. 

Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      
do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of 
diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise ""disposable needlesused here."" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, 
being poorly manufactured and too ""sharp"" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        
If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get 
their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      
The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly 
use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              
patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates 
this risk. Better quality needles tend to ""slide"" past vessels and            
nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        
Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all 
solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into 
meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require 
the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be 
injected into the body as it would  be in a typical ""shot."" when the skin is 
puntured. On the other hand when the solid 
acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to ""squeeze"" the needle 
from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that 
haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain 
on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. 

Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory 
and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture 
site.


While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease 
transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for 
what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

Are you one of those people who were born when Istanbul was called 
Konstantinopolis? I don't think so! If those people use it because
they are used to do so, then I understand. But open any map
today (except a few that try to be political) you will see that the name 
of the city is printed as Istanbul. So, don't try to give
any arguments to using Konstantinopolis except to cause some
flames, to make some political statement.

Hi,

	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
So it led a ""sheltered"" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2"" hole in a bulkhead
(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable.


	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.


	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer.

I have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either. And I don't think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown.

Hey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get
killed. It's just that simple.

Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term ""always"" is
rather deceptive, I admit.

Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning
exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so
easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should
behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances
at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to
strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world
peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)
 
>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)
>Can you reconcile this?

Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does
preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to
everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is
largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is 
where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  
 
>It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
>on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  

God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly 
unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate 
interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially
when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, Master of Wsidom, 
							       ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. /sigh.

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE, 
   and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.

   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my
   point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.

If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?

Worthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.

   ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up. 
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?
I'll let you in on a secret... It's not for real.. Take my word for it.

   |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because
   any system can solve it. 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). 

I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that 
mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your 
reply.

   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
	   ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal
						^^^                  ^^^
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.
	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of
	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.""
				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967
				   (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)

Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
something back.


   ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). 

   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !

   I think that is fair enough .

No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land. 


   ""The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children"".
			   -Rabbi Shoham.

Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL

As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and
left.
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was
in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old
that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?
I don't think I'll over forget this story.

Subject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 121


I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

    As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes
    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who
    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going
    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's
    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to
    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case
    of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was
    this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give

    A laudable precaution.  
    
    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray
    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an
    integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents
    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are
    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The
    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.

    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you 
    have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable 
    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing 
    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude 
    against Israel and the need to vent it.  You 
    
    This 'Center for Policy Research' stuff is nonsense.

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of 
Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never 
abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally 
hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the
parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole 
perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 
15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop 
Makarios.

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with 
the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right 
given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently 
and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For 
those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island 
since 1571. 

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which

GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me.""

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

 Date : 1 January, 1964. 

 IL GIARNO (Italy)
 
 THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.

 Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we
 are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people
 abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This 
 time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to 
 cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.

 Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno
 Date: 14 January 1964

 DAILY HERALD (London)

 AN APPALLING SIGHT

And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.
Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted
mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.

In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 
wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From
this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village
did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.


 DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)
 
 GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE

 Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the
 Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found
 crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were
 brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three 
 more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could
 not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to 
 locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

No the members of the first group are not necessarily
arrogant.  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain
that the volcano will erupt, I expect them to say so ""No,
but I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have
determined that the volcano will erupt,"" rather than, ""Yes, I am
absolutely certain.""  When it comes to religious discussions,
arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of
statement.

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.  

Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use?

fix the table in .../X11R5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
use xmodmap(1).

put
  stty pass8; setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1; setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character

I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
I ran QA/PLUS, Check It, Diagnose, as well as several shareware
memory checkers. I had a total of 8 meg SIMM in my system.
these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't
place on a memory chip. Out of exahperation I came up with
the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. I found 2
(moral : never buy memory stamped ""not for sensitive or critical 
applications"" on the back.
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on. Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows. I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is.

p.s. man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with

What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin
Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)
getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say
$3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements
for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle 
ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure
out how many, how often, where to, etc...)

Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I
know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft
designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what
the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to 
eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this
portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.

And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the
intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers
that show %20 ROI, fund me...)


Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that
just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace
companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things
ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,
ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european
spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements
that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)
ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

Any feedback?

Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them
a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd
amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
did in Waco.

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.
SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine!
And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

""First they came for the Jews, but I did not stop them, because I was
not a Jew: Then they came for the catholics, but I did not stop them
because I was not a catholic! Then they came for the lutherans, but

If the NRA reads this, then never mind about the address.

Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
those two names)

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the
current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
as an ""oh goody"" step upwards.

And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now.

It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need
a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses.

* What is a product cipher?

  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
  operations such as substitution, transposition, modular
  addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block
  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,
  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of
  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern
  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks
  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre
  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product
  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,
  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,
  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.

  The following table compares the main parameters of several product 
  ciphers:

  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds
  LUCIFER          128               128                16
  DES               64                56                16
  LOKI              64                64                16
  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5
  PES               64               128                 8

* What makes a product cipher secure?

  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be
  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown
  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a
  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''
  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a
  complex nonlinear fashion.

  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are
  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES
  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria
  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be
  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].

* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?

  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.
  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,
  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit
  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit
  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.
  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all
  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from
  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate
  a large subset of S_{2^N}.

  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple
  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a
  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the
  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all
  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)
  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number
  of rounds.

  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an
  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does
  not exist a third key K3 such that

  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)

  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If
  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then
  we say that E is a group.

  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was
  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their
  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a
  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].

* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?

  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under
  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K
  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.
  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K
  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some
  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial
  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot
  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal
  decision is no better than simply guessing.

  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions.

* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?

  There are four standard ""modes of operation"" (and numerous non-standard
  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.
  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,
  published in 1980.  See the question about ""ECB"" below for more details.

  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the ""modes of
  operation"" can be used with any block cipher.

* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?

  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself 
  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one
  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and 
  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
  that were authenticated using that key.
  
  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message
  authentication using DES.

* What exactly is DES?

  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product 
  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  

  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].
  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.
  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)
  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. 

* What is triple DES?

  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit 
  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES
  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.
  The ""DES modes of operation"" may also be used with triple-DES.

  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.

  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985
  ""Financial Institution Key Management"" and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for ""Automated Key Distribution"".  Its
  formal name is ""Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key
  Pair"", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.

  That standard says (section 7.2.1): ""Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long
  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key.""

  Others use the term ""triple-DES"" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or
  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).

  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on
  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key
  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on
  its own part.)

* What is differential cryptanalysis?

  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on
  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by
  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the
  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.
  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,
  notably FEAL [BI91a].

  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a
  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the
  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required
  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required
  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key
  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.
  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many
  known plaintexts.

  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling
  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key
  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,
  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus
  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.
  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that
  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant
  improvement in the differential attack.

  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say
  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''

* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?

  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that
  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES
  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of
  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their
  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,
  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes
  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....
  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''
  
  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in
  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States
  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE
  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development
  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;
  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and
  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their
  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''

  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.
  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the
  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense
  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman
  presented above.

* Is DES available in software?

  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for
  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];
  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].
  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].

  FIPS 46-1 says ""The algorithm specified in this standard is to be
  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard.""  Despite this, software
  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.

* Is DES available in hardware?

  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.
  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.

  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES
  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM
  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,
  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is
  214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom
  marketing.''

  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.

* Can DES be used to protect classified information?

  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:
  ""This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for
  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following
  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and
  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act
  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.""

* What are ""ECB"", ""CBC"", ""CFB"", and ""OFB"" encryption?

  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt 
  messages, files, and blocks of data, known as ""modes of operation.""
  Four ""modes of operation"" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2), 
  and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.   

  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the
  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.
  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.

  The four DES modes of operation are: 
	Electronic Code Book  (ECB), 
	Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), 
	K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and 
	K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).

  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.

  Some symbols:

  P[n]	The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  C[n]	The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to
  	decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.

  E(m)	The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.

  D(m)	The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using
  	the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys
  	in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).

  IV	A 64-bit ""initialization vector"", a secret value which, along with
  	the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.

  I[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.
  R[n]	The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.

  LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)

  MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.
  	e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)

  = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.


  Electronic Code Book (ECB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[n] = E(P[n])		P[n] = D(C[n])


  Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  C[0] = E(P[0]^IV)		P[0] = D(C[0])^IV
  (n>0)	  C[n] = E(P[n]^C[n-1])		P[n] = D(C[n])^C[n-1]


  k-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = C[n-1]			I[n] = C[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  CFB notes: Since I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the
  previous operation, the E() function can be performed in parallel with
  the reception of the text with which it is used.


  k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB):

  	  P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.  

  	  Encryption:			Decryption:
  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)		R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  	  Note that for k==64, this reduces to:

  	  I[0] = IV			I[0] = IV
  (n>0)	  I[n] = R[n-1]			I[n] = R[n-1]	
  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])		R[n] = E(I[n])
  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]		P[n] = C[n]^R[n]

  OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.  Since I[n] is
  independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of
  the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.


  Additional notes on DES ""modes of operation"":

  ECB and CBC use E() to encrypt and D() to decrypt, but the feedback modes
  use E() to both encrypt and decrypt.  This disproves the erroneous claim
  that systems which feature E() but not D() cannot be used for data
  confidentiality, and therefore are not subject to export controls.

His _heart_? This jerk doesn't have a heart, and it beats me why you're

You have it slightly wrong. They dumped the encryption system because
they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for
U.S. use. There are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong
cryptography -- yet.

There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both
atheists AND theists.  I'm sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist
side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at
genocide.  Perhaps, since I'm a bit weak on history, somone here would like
to give a list of wars caused/led by theists?  I can think of a few (Hitler
claimed to be a Christian for example) but a more complete list would
probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement

Better idea for use of NASA Shuttle Astronauts and Crew is have them be found
lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space/time glitch..

Maybe age Jemison a few years (makeup and such) and have her as the only
survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost.. 

Heh of late, they way they have been having shuttle problems in the media,
anything can happen.. 

Imagine a Astronaut/Crew member to find themselves in the 24th Century as the
object of interest of an alien civilization, maybe rescued or helped by the ST
Enterprise...  I know Vegr and such was okay, but this could be better..

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with
""Kartagener's syndrome"", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic
infections. ""Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in
absence of this, laterality can be ""random."" People with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their
rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong
side). 

According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current
information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking
about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of
which there is probably one at NCSU.

Perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with
S1 and S2, and if these agencies are really trusted (ACLU & NRA is an
interesting example), we can hope that they'll use some physical
process to come up with truly random numbers. If the NSA comes up with
the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.

April 16, 1993
Washington, DC

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newly-announced ""Public Encryption
Management"" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.

        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to
open the development of non-military computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards.

        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the so-called ""digital signature standard"" (DSS), a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
DSS.

        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications, as reflected in today's official
statement,  ""a step in the right direction.""  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny.  ""At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation.  It is
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to
play a leading role in the development process.""

        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer
industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of
technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and
maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,
Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional information on

It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado

Unrealistic for now. Maybe we should first just expand Finnish league to
allow teams from Baltic countries to entry!  Then others will get interested
in the idea, that maybe one should settle something bigger. The ultimate 
goal, as you want it, would be European Division in NHL. Btw. does that

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never 
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it.  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things
that don't get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.

Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians,

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

Hi,
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.
(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.

Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM,
if you use EISA-Bus.
Has someone experience with VLB ??
I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB.

As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager 
I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with 
the results.  The catalog description is as follows:

	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager 
	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a
	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two
	counter-rotating ""thumbs"" that move in one-inch orbits --
	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.

	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109

To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or
fax at 1-800-345-4021.

********
NOTE:
When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price
was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog
enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  
QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,
and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it
looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the
first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a
reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to
ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could 
use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old 
one.  VERY reasonable people.
********

I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I 
would be described as ""structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches 
and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  
If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough
time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, 
more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require 
physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit 
to get the prescription for p.t.  

The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache
(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my 
physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles 
in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the 
headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to 
while it is being massaged.

I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing
someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my 
neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in 
the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient 
p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up 
in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.

I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base
unit is about a 14"" x 9"" rectangle, about 3-3/4"" high, with handles on each
side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal ""thumbs"" are about 
1-1/2"" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2"" above the base.  The thumbs 
are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more 
toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in 
either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side 
of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either
side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck
or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.

For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if 
laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or 
neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or
standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are
also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I 
don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works 
well for me.

For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager
behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or
not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  
If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches 
whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use 
than the commonly used ""home-made"" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together 
(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and 
move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than 
nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are 
not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't 
pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this 
is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple 
considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.

Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion 
for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my
neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard
against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a
few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  
After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, 
the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  
I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the 
most vulnerable point for me.

It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,
although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at
a time) to really work it out.

I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I
cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had
it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also 
to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have
been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this 
was very timely  for me.

This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently
became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been
in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,
while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog
products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought
put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones
I've seen such as ""Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog"" or ""Mature Wisdom"".
I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no
big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, 
particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would 
like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""

re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93

This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2
or DOS apps not running under Windows.

One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that
their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost
everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)
discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept
an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry
errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or
FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer
than with the old 2400bps modem.


There are three reasons for the problem:

1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most
   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the
   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high
   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and
   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded
   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.

2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and
   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely
   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you
   are losing data, you may be advised that ""you need to upgrade to a
   16550"". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance
   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the
   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve
   my own problem had never heard the term ""16550"" and many didn't even
   know what a UART was.

3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade
   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience
   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers
   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this
   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications
   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem
   by themselves.

If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of
the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid
overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers
were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem
card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they
are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.
Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.


The Hardware Situation.

The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250
or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace
them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft
diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*
bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from
accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.

The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with
configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to
460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in
pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access
cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but
it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,
see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.

So, what UART component do you have?

Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM
board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with
the numbers ""8250"" or ""16450"", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,
and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE
your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket
COM board.

If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in
Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several
suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The ""N"" chip is the normal 40-pin
dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550
chips without the ""A"" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).

Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those
of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various
IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states
support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:
National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552
Chips&Technology:       82C607
Texas Instruments:      t16c550a
Silicon Systems:        73M550
VLSI                    16C550
TurboCom warns about the pre-""A"" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,
says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70
systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).

If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-
market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you
may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to
either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to
COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).

Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the
problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology
MCT-AIO+ card from:

JDR Microdevices
2233 Samaritan Drive
San Jose  CA  95124
(800) 538-5000 voice US
(408) 559-1200 voice other
(800) 538-5005 FAX US

The MCT-AIO+ (and the ""+"" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit
ISA card providing:

Port Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments
COM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket

Parallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7
Game       ribbon

The kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM
port, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for
the ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can
be individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,
DCD, and DSR jumpers.

JDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.

I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards
with 16550s:

TSD Systems
(407) 331-9130
$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.

PHONE: (407) 331-1424
FAX: (407) 331-8606
2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39

I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,
and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based
8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set
the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.


The Software Situation

Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun
problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the
16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1
drivers have the following limitations:
 - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.
 - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt
   rate of 10x during uploads.
 - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2
   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).
 - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.
   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1
   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would
   be effective.
 - The API won't accept rates above ""CBR_128000"".
 - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even
   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit
   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.
 - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.
 - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.
 - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port
   speed options above 19200 bps.

These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may
or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).
Rumors suggest they ""may"" be solved in Windows ""4.0"".

You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying
a copy of ""TurboCom"", current version 1.2, from:

Bio-Engineering Research
Pacific CommWare Division
180 Beacon Hill Lane
Ashland  OR   97520-9701
(503) 482-2744 voice
(503) 482-2627 FAX
(503) 482-2633 BBS
MCImail:    344-5374
CompuServe: 71521,760

Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit
cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom
but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company
per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for
an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a
market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They
recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.

I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my
datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely
see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps
when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.
Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts
are still using antique UARTs and drivers.

Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu
in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets
around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will
set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the
Windows APIs and dialog boxes.

I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you
do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is
not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)
standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another
16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving
system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough
to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm
engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all
by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above
115,200 may still be risky.

Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still
experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and
serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to
buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a
16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of
TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of ""Windows Sources"" magazine.
I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with
process priorities and time slices if you are a ""power user"" whose
thrashing system still runs into comm problems.


Closing Soapbox Comments

The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across
the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,
the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be
assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer
companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years
behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation
vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the
initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was
subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the
exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent
I/O.

You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this
situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect
cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs ""sort of""
work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a
hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that
use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the

Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad

him back even in that role.

I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the
world. They were 'our' grandparents who were cold-bloodedly exterminated
by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920, not yours. And you can always
participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish 
and Kurdish people on April 23, 1993 in the United States and Canada. 

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- We also demand that the United States return to the policies 
advocated by U.S. Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen,
who have undertaken a just, human and benevolent attitude towards 
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

Lines: 58

In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write:

>While reading through the DOS 6.0 book, it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive.  To make things compatable,
>I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade.  However, when all the dust settled, and I go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the Windows directory.  My question is:  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't?

you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best
explanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...

The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking
directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must
use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).
Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that
points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your
disk to index to information in that file.

compressed disks are actually ""logical"" disks.  These disks have different
characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information
on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must
go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating
system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this ""inbetween"" program, windows
cannot use direct methods to read from the ""logical"" disk.

a permenant swap file is only there to ""reserve"" an area of the disk that
windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically
not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't
know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you
boot windows.)

a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows
via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded
the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in
order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)

more on permenent swap files...

i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message ""you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this
swap file anyway"" or something like that.

well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.

They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he 
said!

I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it's not going to use it?

any takers?

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this
""bug"" in the thread, so here goes:

It is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,
and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).

Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see
(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully
scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*
You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.
Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse, it seems to ""click"" along.  If this
doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly
recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off.

Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice
that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains
or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

I learned when riding bareback as a kid to ""palm-reign"", by just 
pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn 
left - a lot like countersteering. So that came pretty easy to me in the 
transition to motorcycles. It took a while however to break my habit of

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the ""Black community"" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*
riot!
	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.
	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
luck in avoiding the ""trap"". 
	Peace, my brother.

What the hell do you know about Israeli policy?  What gives you the fiat
to look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation'
been published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs,
specifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My
brain is full of shit?  At least I don't look into the minds of others and 
make Israeli policy for them!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but
I will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I
will blame the Israelis.  Just like Palestinians who send their children into
warzones to throw rocks at armed Israeli soldiers.  What irresponsible parents!
As Golda Meir said, peace will only come when the Arabs start loving their
children more than they hate the Jews.

Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
but a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal
arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence.

{Interesting that you would respond ""emotionally"" in defense of the 
government. Maybe there is a beating heart there.}

For the record though, the biggest-baddest goverment on earth claims 
the most sovereignty over man. Best I can tell God allows anyone to
go to hell who wants to. Omnipotency logically determines that ""allowing""
and ""sending"" mean the same thing.  (Mere human concepts of course.)

So come on WDS. Why bother to try some flimsy facade of logic. Waco
proves it's not needed -- the demonstration that government can walk
over it's own rules in the name of justice has been made. No problem 
by me. Noted and announced -- for the record. Just giving the govern-
ment it's due, and getting back to more worthwhile non-government 
concerns.

Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there
was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
tangible ""thunk"".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. 
My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such
that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the
lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a ""bank-follower"", or a
little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a
100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7
mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the
mystery.

The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm
fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of
the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in
the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something
having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  

Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you
rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without
damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo
that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly
changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid
?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life
goes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.

The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.  People are constantly
calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) ""I was thinking, why don't the Yankees
trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson,
that would really help the team""  or ""Do you think the Yankees can get Roger 
Clemens?"".  The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's
still annoying.

The best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with ""I was 
thinking, why don't the Yankees trade for..."" and then the host hung up on
him.  I cheered!

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based
   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and
   action-based, and the other symbol-based.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. 

To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;
no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there
 are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone
 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about
 graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework
 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. 
 I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package.

 I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.
 The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,
 I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this
 package some more. I also spoke with the author, Mark Owens, another nice
 guy that seems to know his business. The price is $249, no royalties.

It is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the

extended frequency response.

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home.  I've had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than
adequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks
rather similar to Soar's.

Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of 
red herrings and smoke screens.

Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today
through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont
was kind enough to send me):

	Taking action? A white geese be held
	as an accomplice to be held as
	a decision upon the door
	A black and white goose waddles past
	the eyes of the door. 
	Hits it with the confidence interval for 
	that individual is held responsible 
	for that, that individual 
	may be held as a 
	getaway car may be held 
	as an uncountably large number 
	of the driver of something 
	and agree.

	A black goose 
	waddles past the person imprisoned?

	White goose waddles past the 
	confidence interval for the population 
	of geese be axed, 
	fine.
	And white goose 
	waddles past the door.

Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more
coherent?  Less coherent?

Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem
about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being
held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize
an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be
black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the ""getaway car""
tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our
being is not to ""get away"" from responsibility for our actions,
but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the
""driver"" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition
of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal
conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?

Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and
a random number generator?

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If
it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.
Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites.

Hi, Ravi

If you need a Harley, we have lots to spare here. All the yuppies
bought 'the best' a couple  of years ago to pose at the (s)wine
bar. They 'rode a mile and walked the rest'. Called a taxi home and 
went back to the porsche. So there's are loads going cheap with about
1 1/2 miles on the clock (takes a while to coast to a halt).

Cheers

It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't 
thought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal
that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They
seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without 
explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application
I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's
great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.

They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use
IRQ7!.
     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes
me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,
then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore
no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,
thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.

     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port
activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused!.

Windows may be a different story....

   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.

I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is
not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.

   [snip]
   imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....

I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist
camps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion. 

   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
   are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.

Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you
describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,
backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah
and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,
while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing, which would have produced major casualties.

   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.

Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks.

   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
   realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
   would have resulted in.  

Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though.

   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
   in all other parts of Lebanon.

No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.

   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.

I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have
much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
in programming X.

At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style.  They are:

Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program
  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.

Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients
  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.


Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)
electronic form?

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net.)

Thanks,

David Simpson

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the 
same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will
come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, 
and the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their
helicopters, rolling dice.

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and 
basing their count on those.  I see two problems with this.  One, can they 
get *everybody* to take one (and only one)?  Two, they couldn't possibly have
been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!

This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived
immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son
Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a
stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of
hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on
his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.
 It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and
thus he became the ""Elevator of the heavens.""  This ""god"" made men able to
""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the God of Heaven could not
see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of
His laws.""  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""Emancipator""
or ""Deliverer""  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system
and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many
benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a
Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other
actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it
as true.

>The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is

I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to
the coming ""Anointed One"" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who
was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the
Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the
dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it
as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation
via faith and nothing else.

I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it
because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the
eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal
life is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of
consciousness.  

>It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous

It depends upon your def of ""lost.""  The elect were lost only in time as
outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. 
Existentially we were all born ""lost"", but the ""righteous"" were ""in Christ"" and
therefore never *assuredly* lost.

Couldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is
clearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring

Ah!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I

Look at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very
interesting study.

Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the
underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as ""mystery"" religions
for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private
side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they
revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings
to light. The ""Mystery of Iniquity"" that we find in the Bible, correlates to
this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,
little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would
not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point
today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in
Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the ""husband son."")

No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the
church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their
worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you
are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to
expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which
they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and
discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also
the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's ""Egyptians.""  He really
does a number on what the Greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from the
Egyptians.

I'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that

Each age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the
Trinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today,
eschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out
in detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was
insufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that
we have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One
age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is
given growth.  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden
appropriate for the growth of eschatology, wouldn't it?

to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him
axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. ""Argumentum
ad silence-your-opponent-um""?! I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).

The issue that seems to be: ""Is the following an advertisement?""
Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...

1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 
	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post
	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of ""Newsweek"",
	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.
2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	""proof"" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and
	behold, ""poof"", there goes my account. This one had an
	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get
""Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..."" or whatever; they
only get ""I don't like what that user is doing because..."".
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying ""Thanks for
the info"" or ""Could you send me such and such?"" or ""Your posts are
very interesting... keep it up."" and only a handfull of ""Go aways"". But,
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...""My name is Ted and
and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them..."")
NWO Indeed!

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.
I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post
to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. 
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.
Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I
was just getting started.

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of ""interest"" to the government, and Ted sure seems
to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does
he work for? The University of Chicago which he ""attends""(?) is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...

And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I

[Editor's Note: The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced

[Ted Frank] It's inexcusable to post 150 lines of bounced mail headers to four

yes i agree. BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here  
makes.
we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape (which i assume this is ment to be).
we (CS operations) don't like to get involved in this stuff (unless
its illegal, repetitive posts of 1gig gifs, harassment, or something
else that offends the community in general). my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look

Although, others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm.


>What features are important?

I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all
doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in 
a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock,
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.

Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places
may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how
much it cost) will be a major burden.


>What features are unimportant?

IMO, things like engine starters, voice alarms, window/sunroof open
and close, and most other conveniences.

Hi there,

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C650 regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650
has the message ""fpu: optional"".  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80
configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list?
I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.
Why say ""optional"" if it's built in?
Please, anybody help me understand this game.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.

  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from
NSA.)

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is really scary.  Since the ""expectation"" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security.

I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one

the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But
for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these.  
Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive
and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in
picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough
that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you
can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can
lock in on one and average the others out.

The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts
of interactions with the building. Just moving a folded dipole around is also
highly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to
another,

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality

moral system.

I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous
and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost
every moral system agrees on these two points.

Well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously,
then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.

Fine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base.

We can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,
tolerance, etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  Xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions are

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't

What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored
transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to
do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed
more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Look
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
of ours.

With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with

Subject: Asante EN/SC hangs SCSI devices
Reply-To: behr@math.ilstu.edu (Eric Behr)
Organization: Central Illinois Surfing Club
Lines: 31

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC
adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -
specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac
tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the
power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use
the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable.

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has
*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had
it for over a year).

Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --
several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the
head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator
(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal
resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another
identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?
Thanks a lot.    E.

Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous
post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something.
Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something.  Everything else
works great though.

I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.
(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:

1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 

2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines. 

3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.
	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).

4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed.

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even 
simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department 
of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets.

Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be 
the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to 
order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I 
want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on 
electronically.

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.

Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, 
all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is ""good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide.""  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just 
as much as ""no one needs an assault rifle"".

But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of
natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than
the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
complicated than ""the law of the jungle.""  I don't think that
self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by
objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be
carried out completely.

Once again, where's your proof? Suicide is considered a sin by Branch
Davidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to
commit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not
suicidal.  David Thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire
was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities
knocked over a lantern.

I'd like to point out that the Bible says ""Do not commit murder."" The NKJ
translation mistranslates.  Self-defense was never considered murder.  The
reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the
government would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded.

How was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does

that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand
that that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit

Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I
do not believe that RSA would consent to such.  

However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which
NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of
implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or
maximum modulus size.  

It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within
bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert
means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
all of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware;
they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)

I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective

pro-RKBA arguments presented here.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a
million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number
of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,
it is surprising that the ""Evil AntiGun Empire "" (Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare
""All legitimate gun defenses"" vs. ""All gun crimes.""  Instead, 
it's always ""All legitimate gun defenses,""  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and
cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just 
criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which
the victim died.

Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred.

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is
fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen 
gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3/4"" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can
manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...
So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what

This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys

Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc.,
and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number?
Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification
(the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a
Clipper-equipted phone?

Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this 
information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave

They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal
manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police
have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of
the guns they conficate were illegally built.

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's
time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket
prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten
times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.
resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and
buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs
and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
can not be easily side-stepped.

Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,
you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad
example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal
copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and

it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction
in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm)
and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer
could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
reappear on the streets...)

Perhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs 
also tried to invade Slovinia. They were driven out after a few
weeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.
The Afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.

Not that I think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples
of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by Aristotle in
_Nicomachean_Ethics_.   Note that you can't use this insight to reason
backwards; e.g.:  Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative, the media are fair!  (though
I've seen this ""reasoning"" implied)

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy ""you're not in
Kansas anymore"" Denning).  The article was titled ""Government slowly
eroding our liberties"", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being
        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.
        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we
        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as
        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken
        a little bit at a time.

The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the
water is getting pretty warm.""  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the
Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

Let me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same
result. Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what??

Subject: Another key registration body bites the dust (IMHO)
Organization: Yale CS Mail/News Gateway
Lines: 46

One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good
reason.

When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the
auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always
figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix
the problem.

Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.
Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The
auditee can say, ""Well, you told us this way would be OK.""  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job.

Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.
Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets
away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.
But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.

There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one
place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum
was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again
today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU
conflict of interest.

As always, my opinions are my own.

                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE

[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- 
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with 
the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]

Dear Adrian:  

I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to 
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and 
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist 
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back 
with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present 
now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the 
future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  

There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger 
of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 
10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, 
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic 
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll 
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent 
with your note.  

First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't 
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my 
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  

Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't 
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions 
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older 
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  

Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on 
countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND 
BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this 
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  

Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat 
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you 
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in 
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our 
ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree 
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  
More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s 
clearly indicate the contrary.  

Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human 
behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The 
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the 
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  

Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates 
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but 
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social 
benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a 
criminal offense.  

Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials 
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are 
many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless 
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it 
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that 
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, 
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's 
permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists 
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed 
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  
Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" 
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, 
ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in 
the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, 
and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we 
probably manufacture at least that many every year.

The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly 
aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what 
their real motives are.  

Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, 
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; 
the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the 
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing 
this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a 
quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" 
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna 
be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.

As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law 
provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I 
will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is 
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands 
-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can 
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given 
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics 
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  

So what's the point?

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization
of the S3 card.

InitDisplay;
	(*BIOS-Call
		with AX-Reg = 4F02H
		with BX-Reg = 105H for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution

Unlock Graphic Command Group (CR40)
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Syst. Configuration Register *)
Unlock Advanced Display Functions
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Function Control Register *)

After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty.
When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get
the value 0FH instead of 0H.
Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H
(0 places occupied).

It is possible to read this register in two different ways. 
Both times we get different results.



Our machine is a 486 DX/2 with EISA bus and a S3 86C805 local bus.

And of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company, and
since the phone company complies with court orders, they will know the

then can present the warrant to the key escrow house.

                           Washington, D.C.   



8:30 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you 
in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking 
part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.
	     
	     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas 
Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to 
mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he 
has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all 
followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education 
here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according 
to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational 
system.
	     
	     His philosophy of government, his belief in the 
importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest 
here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us 
President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in 
the Chamber of Commerce studios.  
	     
	     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for 
taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite 
network and we welcome you here this evening.
	     
	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  
And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening 
also.
	     
	     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure 
many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that 
you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In 
Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.
	     
	     I believe the President has a few words that he might 
want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that 
at this time.  It's great to have you.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
	     
	     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob 
Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the 
Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, 
along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine 
tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people 
from school to the work place.
	     
	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, 
recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this 
economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to 
work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to 
make things happen.
	     
	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that 
kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home 
state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart 
Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing 
several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I 
appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all 
the rest of you.
	     
	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward 
constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about 
this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson 
believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in 
education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, 
freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and 
third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  
	     
	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this 
beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful 
cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change 
with changing times.
	     
	     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit 
and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we 
can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --
about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless 
we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in 
government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase 
our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the 
long run.
	     
	     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  
And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven 
or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system 
and continues into the work force where education must go on for a 
lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can 
learn.
	     
	     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing 
we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership 
between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the 
private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're 
trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that 
would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many 
thousands that have a strong education component so our young people 
can be learning and working at the same time.
	     
	     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good 
place we can begin, I think, the discussion.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.
	     
	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all 
citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And 
tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours 
can prepare students for this world of work.
	     
	     This week, the Education Department and the Labor 
Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called 
Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  
The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's 
proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched 
jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged 
areas of the country.  
	     
	     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it 
somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls 
for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your 
words is that so important?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  
First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may 
have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want 
them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to 
continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of 
research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may 
forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year 
over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for 
schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already 
taught before.
	     
	     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, 
not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to 
abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is 
learning because we think that the best and most productive workers 
will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience 
could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to 
succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are 
disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go 
into the next year, is really even greater.  
	     
	     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs 
throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this 
educational component of training.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. 
Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer 
or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with 
education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, 
for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning 
geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or 
working on something, and they can see the exact and direct 
application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a 
lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between 
education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  
It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of 
young people even beyond the summer.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  
	     
	     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship 
program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell 
us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it 
developing.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why 
it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade 
will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will 
require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people 
get in a high school diploma.  
	     
	     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries 
of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school 
education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young 
people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not 
go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because 
they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their 
employers.
	     
	     So we think America has a big economic interest in 
trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school 
but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes 
two years of further training either in a community college, a 
vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in 
this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some 
funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states 
and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in 
a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, 
based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could 
revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and 
the earnings of American workers.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think 
you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the 
people watching this program -- that the business community and 
educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many 
of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In 
fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The 
people watching this program probably are the ones who are most 
directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley 
and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes 
already out there.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight 
about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  
career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal 
with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of 
these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and 
you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much 
longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business 
community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're 
doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The 
Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these 
kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've 
aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.
	     
	     The business community is going to be actively engaged 
in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and 
helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions 
develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.
	     
	     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is 
one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these 
players in a community come together and work together and cooperate 
together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and 
the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody 
is talking, but they're not really working together in a common 
strategy.
	     
	     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, 
would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic 
excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a 
tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to 
make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be 
eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year 
college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're 
talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation 
skills for on-the-job learning.
	     
	     And again, those are the critical components.  It's 
already being done.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one 
point based on my personal experience at home -- the business 
community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are 
the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, 
but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort 
of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are 
going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the 
second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and 
influence them.  So I think that's very important.
	     
	     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at 
the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some 
funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make 
sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the 
quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to 
determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of 
course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery 
program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about 
long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. 
President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the 
communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be 
coming forth before too long.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I 
were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public 
schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that 
a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  
	     
	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals 
that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President 
Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to 
do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in 
Congress that will actually define the things that the national 
government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the 
children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those 
goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school 
ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school 
graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are 
confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are 
second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, 
disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took 
them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of 
life-long learning in this country.
	     
	     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a 
state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector 
role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to 
introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; 
and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job 
is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality 
that we need to meet.
	     
	     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite 
like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  
Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their 
money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and 
partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really 
it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms 
of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to 
support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform 
efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.
	     
	     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to 
the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of 
course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and 
I wonder if you would comment on that.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of 
our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they 
don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system 
of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had 
national skill standards to which they could aspire and which 
employers would understand as a national credential, many of these 
young people would actually find that they were much more eligible 
for jobs.
	     
	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other 
countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to 
college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain 
technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If 
you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to 
develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working 
with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private 
industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the 
kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other 
institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go 
ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce 
Todd of Austin, Texas.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and 
Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We 
have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who 
have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me 
simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with 
much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are 
very supportive.  
	     
	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our 
summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to 
have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much 
as 3,500 with the federal assistance.  
	     
	     Much of the question that we had designed you have 
answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But 
the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day 
would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round 
is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal 
level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-
round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the 
local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's 
something that we believe is very important to success in this 
effort.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to 
answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, 
and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  
I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  
	     
	     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can 
structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer 
program and that will move a lot of these young people back into 
schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in 
the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to 
try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs 
to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're 
working on that.
	     
	     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the 
Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to 
build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job 
training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give 
heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you 
asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we 
hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being 
trained on a year-round basis.
	     
	     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said 
a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen 
as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people 
actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when 
they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we 
hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and 
we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget 
cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue 
raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be 
able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.
	     
	     Bob, do you want to say anything?
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out 
of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, 
and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high 
school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in 
addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of 
jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  
It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the 
economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything 
else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I 
think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I 
think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or 
greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going 
to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything 
right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 
will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into 
next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it 
will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working 
together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And 
then the state, with all the various school districts, a very 
important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I 
think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that 
moving.
	     
	     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  
	     
	     Doctor?
	     
	     Q	  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to 
be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school 
and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since 
its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two 
alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages 
we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an 
extremely effective learning strategy.
	     
	     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are 
several principles that are very important in bridging the school and 
work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with 
practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure 
to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect 
upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and 
lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the 
development of high performance competencies.  
	     
	     My question, then is:  How can the general education 
faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with 
transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies 
can you suggest to achieve this integration?
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- 
and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting 
work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next 
guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   
in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to 
them and we can discuss it later.
	     
	     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one 
thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as 
clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the 
people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more 
explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics 
is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish 
what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is 
vocational learning and what is academic learning.
	     
	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think 
we should have a strong component for people who are in the 
vocational program.
	     
	     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to 
rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and 
work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're 
important for all students.  It's not just a special group of 
students that needs them.
	     
	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United 
States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream 
experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and 
12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience 
and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on 
to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they 
can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and 
career directions.
	     
	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often 
goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-
related work within the classroom, within our schools.
	     
	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's 
going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I 
think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank 
you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and 
your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  

                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT

Subject: Parity Error - System Halted /anyone have any ideas?
Organization: Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago
Lines: 28

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says
the board is a ""391 WB/H.""  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine
also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether
the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.

	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays ""Parity Error --
System Halted"" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to ""disabled"" or ""enabled"" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).
Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all
worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).

	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them
in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.

	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/
parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).

	CAN ANYONE HELP?

Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the
pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player
is on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
game than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their
part of the offense, but that's another issue.)

That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  They
hit pretty well in addition to their defense.

I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card. 
The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more 
than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory. 

The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable! They are still using 2400bps 
modem! It will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you
are calling long distance. Is there any ftp site that has a collection
of video drivers for windows?

BTW, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far?

Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford (4 games to two),

I disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other 
standards in place.  Besides, even if they restrict encryption on the NREN, 
who cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.  The NREN is only for

Local to the Joe Louis Arena? You mean local to Olympia Stadium, where
Red Wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to
mind). As far as I know, the rest of the post is basically correct. If
what you meant by local was simply Detroit and I'm being incredibly

but this just doesn't seem to be the place, a public forum, to spew foul language,

On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the
family of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before
the raid.

This strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;
any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.

In Viet Nam, Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because his
troops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. It is time
that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to
standards at least as moral as the military's.

I am familiar with inductive logic.  Go ahead and give me the details
of the ""logic"" that led you to conclude, incorrectly, that I would
condone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context.  Your conclusion was
wrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were
guity of taking verses out of context.  Nothing hypocritical about
that, is there?  

Since you reached a false conclusion, you made some mistake in your
""logic.""  The only question is where.  Did you think that it would
be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?
Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of
evidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp of
inductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figure

it.

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative
action laws of the 60's did.
My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights
have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord
finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of
a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired.
Do you REALLY think these are justified ?

If one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home

Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles

Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.

Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation
of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.  But
Einstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's motion, and analysis
of Mercury's motion now shows there are _not_ any planets inside its orbit.

Hadashot, 14 March 1993:

The Israeli Police Department announced on the evening of Friday,
March 12 that it is calling upon [Jewish] Israeli citizens with
gun permits to carry them at all times ""so as to contribute to
their security and that of their surroundings"".

Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993:

Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee,
stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
[non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:

Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern
Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza
strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
measures in the Strip.

The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents
as they leave for work in Israel. They can be used to reveal the
presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects.

In addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private
civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading
devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate
the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must
carry.

Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars,
you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the
bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.
You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the
tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.

(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put
them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as
soft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very
often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.

It's my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the
growing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun, due to it's
elliptical orbit. It is not due to shadowing effects.

This is an interesting notion -- and one I'm scared of. In my
case I'm a Finnish citizen, I live in USA, and I have to conform
to the US laws. However, the Finnish government is not actively
checking out what I'm doing in this country, in other words checking
out if I conform to the Finnish laws.

However, Islamic law seems to be a 'curse' that is following you

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

Subject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity
Organization: University of Arizona, Tucson
Lines: 75

Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other
than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from
Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be
ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).

Later,
Max (Bob) Muir

[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly
cited passages are:

the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and
there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate
position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the
Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known
specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a
cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,
homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action
described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about
as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of
guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically
about homosexuality.

In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom
1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.
Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about
idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at
least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this
passage.  It does not use the word ""homosexuality"", and it is referring
to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.
So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.
But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,
that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards 
homosexuality.

The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim
1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here
mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,
such as ""wanton"", and that another may be specifically ""male
prostitute"".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about
homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul
shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.

Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The
context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in
Sodom were angels, it seems likely that ""strange flesh"" refers to
intercourse with angels.

As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is
determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that
the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT
prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT
endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no
clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in
Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly
do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is
legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his
background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.

This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long
dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's
clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down
to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they
believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This
appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a
whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.
This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference
between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both
sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they
keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the
other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things
very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic
outcome is not very likely...

How typical.  So you think we shouldn't avoid these 'events' [ I shall
refrain from the word disaster since it seems to upset you so much.  :( ]
when we can.  In case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,

ones we do.

I guess you missed the show on Ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster
[ oops there I go again... I meant to say event ] on the Exxon Valdez.
Just a natural every day occurance to spread oil on 300 Miles of beach. I
would like to know which natural event [ hey I remembered not to say disaster ]
that would be similar to this.

You write as if no-one ever became a Christian except people from

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings ""near UV light"" /is/ ""actual UV light.""  The ""near"" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
""far UV"" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were

anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up

Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using
several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I
missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG)
that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is
fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my
solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into
the kernel.

I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks
were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on
reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay
to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes
a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of
solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off
the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K
after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have
guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and
still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.

at $99.00!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to

To clarify:  

VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no product
called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its
version as 8.00).  C7 is not a ""DOS""-only product -- it is a C/C++
compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is
VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with
many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in
creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by
automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial
impressions have been very favorable.

Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a
considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you
haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!

Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me 
as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with
translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people
group he was serving.
WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture
in minority languages.

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this
along the lines of ""ideological manipulation and cultural
interference"" is probably no more than Christianising and
education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian
missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked
among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

(1)  Stephen said you took a quote out of context
(2)  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article
     (call it A) that took a quote out of context
(3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the
     lack of X  (a common creationist error)
(4)  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(5)  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK,
     or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite.  
(6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned
     taking quotes out of context in A.
(7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins
     ""Could you please explain ..."" was not a nonsequitur, but was intended
     to follow from the sentence that preceded it.
(8)  Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen
     condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(9)  But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this
(10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen
     thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A, and were 
     making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists.

Is that better Jim?   It's called an argument.  If you disagree with it,
explain why the argument is not sound.  (I admit that my assumption in (7)
may have been a bit hasty.)  If you agree with it, just say ""yup.""

04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES

By David Ljunggren

MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons
x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it
might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.

Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest
offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in
the Transcaucasian region soaring.

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the
Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending 
planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.

It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about
the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as 
saying.

""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate
measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft
units.""

Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the
conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which
more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.

The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to
Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.

A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly
on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket
launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.

Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops
and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where
they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.

""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the
country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.

Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops 
involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.

Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive
along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.

""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent
inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)
leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.

Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in
Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of
Commonwealth leaders.

""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the
protection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying.
     
At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have
collapsed.

""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the
legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he
said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not 
been recognised by any other country.

Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future
peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.

Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender
Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with
Armenia, had resigned.

Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.
Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of
Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official
confirmation.

Cosmologist Stephen Hawking tours Lab

By Karre Marino
     Some 15 years after his first visit to JPL, Prof. Stephen
Hawking, Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge
University and author of ""A Brief History of Time,"" returned to
the Lab April 5.
     On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine
and Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,
Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab Director
Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, and
felt ""like royalty,"" he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt to
explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate
dimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, ""because while
I'm most interested in those things in space that are farther
away, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.""
     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate
students and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,
as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of
Flight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's project
scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.
     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid
to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should
extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,
they would find a variety of images that would explain something
of Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with
the spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.
     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes
describing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answer
to a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed
drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, ""it's only
a concept."" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five
years before, described the professor as ""a living miracle of the
power of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good sense
of humor.""

entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles
to view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong
showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been
discovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about
its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he
asked several questions on their interpretation.
     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data
Acquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations
Facility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.
     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular
interest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank
Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described
a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.
Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the
philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.
     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern
California for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and
planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab
tour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised
Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.

Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same ""mandate territory"" - read
colony.

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another

all wars of aggression have started.

The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every

So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and 
a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation
because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return
of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the
Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud
beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous
population.

The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the 
redefinition of much land used in common as ""public land"". The assertion
that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to
an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an
excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought
in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the
Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories
must not be changed. 

No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists
will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of
those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.

Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.

If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.


The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the
Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it
is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the
return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the
dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against
non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. 

The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has
a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the
Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean
outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying
or using much of the land.

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the ""o"" are pins, and the ""L5 CR12 C37"" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

  And why are we in Somalia?   When right across the Gulf of Aden are
  some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet?  Why does the 
  US always become the point man for this stuff?   I don't mind us
  helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects
  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these
  events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the
  resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it's 
  not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming
  military force that their neighbors can't handle.  Nor are the 
  logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge 
  to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from 
  Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or 
  Austria to Serbia.

I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.
That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like
so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.

I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I
deign from commenting much further.

Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as
many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that
Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if
you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily
being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,
but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.
 
>So, I think that your position is:

>Did I get that right?

Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*
determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible
human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The 
distinction is subtle yet important.

When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results
are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could
have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,
without sacrificing his convictions.

Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.
Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know
with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the
right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced
much beyond that.

Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that
the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely
certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,
you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all
practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with
Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about
absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability 
that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) 
abandon these absolutes.

As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does
not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to 
render all doubts unreasonable.

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).
The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape
units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group.

Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,
thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to
completely get rid of IDE.

There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role

science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor

fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special
interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a
special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of
discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no
arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are
not likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April

Hi
     I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the
two products.  I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you
how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First
use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. 
Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions
and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken
will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you
do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be
entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will
remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have
three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,
middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.

Gun clubs:
If you are a member you CAN borrow weapons....(Suprised??)
You are supposed to train with a .22 for the 6 months, THEN
you can start with anything bigger.

Drivers licence:
Forgot that USA is THE land of cars.....
Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy.
Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather......
But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and
bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS.
(If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)

Abuse by the goverment:
This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control
would just be abused by the goverment.(!)
Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should
get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)

Guns 'n Criminals:
MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.
Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.
And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),
we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.

Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!
Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to...
I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)

The issue (I hope..):
I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.
Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)

I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:
They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them
to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.

If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
it's the 'axer' ??
(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)

Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works
(in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...
(Something about throwing stones in glass houses...)
Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.
(Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (YES!)

(My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot-guns are from the police
and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa) (understood that one Sorenson??)

LAST WORD:
Responsible gun owners are not a problem, but they will be affected if you want to protect 
your citicens.

        But that's just the problem. There is no such thing as
        ""MIME-Formatted"". By analogy, MIME is a content-labelling

Subject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring
Lines: 163
Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1
Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It
should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the
normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor.  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for
this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in
many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service
entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is
referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance
panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household
service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  

The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In
the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device.  

Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding
conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,
under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the
grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment
has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""
ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. 
The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few
tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not
present a shock hazard.  

HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,
a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you
will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)
Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size, causing it to overheat.

With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which
increases the possibility for shock or fire.  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often
causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for
lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. 
(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not
it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any
sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground, with the possible problems listed above.

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one
building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate
wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. 
These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days
before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place
of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
(since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the
wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. 
So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,
it's primarily for lightning protection.

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good
grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall
tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  

""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield.

""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with
120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the
box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.

On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is
connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,
whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93
code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be
renumbered though.) 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more
to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his. And ""six or seven home runs""? Hmm.

So, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take 
Alomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.

Subject: DC-Y trajectory simulation
Keywords: SSTO, Delta Clipper
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 91


I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a
single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is 
currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.

On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled 
""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of
Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is
not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with 
them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used 
the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope
they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.

The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I
did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters
and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in 
mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:
                  ______
3 G         /|   /      |
           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly 
          /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines
2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are
        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as
       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.

                        |

             ^          ^
           ~100 sec    ~400 sec


As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are 
throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely.

The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed
for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of
air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to 
that desired.

Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)

Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than
    all at once?

A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.

Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?

A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  

My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests?

The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs
of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.
The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have
about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
60 degrees south latitude.

I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that
aspect of the flight profile.

It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a
bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories.
Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill. 

Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether
literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster
no doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome' is bogus.

Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo
effects; people may have allergies in addition.

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC.
Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies,
for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk.

Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the
journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?

But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG.

The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.

Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods,
vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed
foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.

That plastic bodywork is useless. That torque, and an upright riding position is
better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm
low torque motor.

To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists
chrome has very little impact on buying choice.

Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice. 

To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. In other words,
no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser
rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)
  
You're fishing for flames, Dave.

This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
between Sports-car owners, and luxury-car owners. 

This is a moot conversation.

	No, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else
devise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW: the DOE handles
reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these
reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has

	So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics

is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can

	Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have

than trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of
a device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:

1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.

2)  Strong cryptography is ""arms"", according to the U.S. government (that's
    why it's so hard to export).

Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!  
Q.E.D.

However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization?
(Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long
to start up.  I would certainly join.)

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X
Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled ""Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco"".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.

Peir-Yuan Yeh asks:

books >of OT as the same as Torah?????

Yes, yes, and yes.  Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and
as shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.

The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the
Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)
and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,
Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).

And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is
quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past
200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead
Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the
Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas
before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus
was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only
the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as
Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called ""the mighty God.""  And if he
was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not
possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,
your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is
why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.

The Japanese spacecraft, Hiten, crashed on the Moon last weekend.  For the
past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere.  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February 1992, and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon.

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

 A cash award is OK. A time limit would be nice. You can't give away

The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to

                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! 

               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time: 
    
               (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."" 
    
               (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."" 
    
               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL 
          DATUM""). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

               Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available 
          from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), 
          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the 
          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  
          They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
          journal ""RECIPROCITY"". 

          

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", 
          ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super 
          Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the ""Supercollider""?! 
    
          
               Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by 
          INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special 
          Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron 
          stars"", ""black holes"", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black 
          holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and 
          concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original ""black holes"". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black 
          holes"", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is 
          clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black 
          hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to ""prove"" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."" 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).  
          (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and 
          ""below"" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as 
          the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). 



               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring
anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think)
to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone
with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the
time. 

Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell
cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump
up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these
stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling
yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing
to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're
protected from doing what you want with your life.

Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:

Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.
If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You
can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell
that car.

Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone
thinks that it's ""wrong"" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months
rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or
their money, it is your life and your money.

My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.
Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere
dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.

That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make
us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing
what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.
And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency
and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.
And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

   Thanks awfully,
             Patrick

OK..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post.
here's the ""official"" response from orchid..
Orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) SHOULD         (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start
on april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day
just the word of the tech on the other line.

now the flame......
you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs. 
very poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the
janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time I talked to a tech  named ""paul"" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on.
until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy
or recommend orchid products.

flame off.....

again thanks to all of you who answered my post.

Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland
fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. 
I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and
Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).
The program has a lot nice features.
So if interested give me a mail.

Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".

Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'

In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind

we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?

Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them

I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal
clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up
SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.
Check it out.

I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things
seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.
The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what
I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)
agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it
almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse
IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.

I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be
expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored
data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such
expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).
There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please
bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say
what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.

>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The

>today.

As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or
similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions
such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how
this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat
this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other
areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if
this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in
several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not
going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop
whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather
flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the
material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on
periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice
system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty
(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not
protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would
result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions
on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it
does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially
fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the
right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton
and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,
figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come
those consulted could be roughly described as ""us insiders""?  They cannot
quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its
exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.
Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,
past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest
and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'
or 'difficult'.

So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved
after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,
easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,
would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This
has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For
local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds
have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe
for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen
in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or
via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.

This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use
old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping
was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law
Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes
that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I
just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much
about civil and individual rights, that ""puts people first"".  The question
is ""put people first"" to WHERE?

With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T
exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword
scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific
court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.
Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that
they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to
keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After
awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks
they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would
reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember
Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?

And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!
I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice
:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to
a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded
to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get
one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important
concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...

What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You
can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.
It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the
argumet ""well, if you got nothing to hide...""  Fine. Then using that
argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in
every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but
the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a
govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as
to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are
pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.

Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish
bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.

People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,
because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some
'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother
those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few
isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a
certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected
experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was
advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the
experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper
Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled
version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the
version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who
chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...
:-)

And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT
have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?
I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything
you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this
group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...

Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not
be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure
but ""good enough"" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full
description (not a PR non-statement) of just what ""good enough"" means?
I think when saying how strong it is, ""good enough"" really means ""not
very"".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not
acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and
Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other
countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as
revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and
protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA
have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of
Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining
for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair
the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but ""too
many rights and safeguards"" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court
system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having
""too many rights"" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,
etc).

BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe
this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades
have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the
Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it
isn't too late allready.

So, like, what do you do during those six months to be ""active?""
My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before
you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.
Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?

Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental
disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the
government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some
trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you
are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.

> It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
> You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US 
is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun
owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.

Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There
are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but
only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot
of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.

Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring
safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But 
they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't 
fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence 
to those with political connections.  Is this fair?

Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.
Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed 
carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage
over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,
then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.
Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for 
these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.

Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other
people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals
affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this
during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts
NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that
the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to
possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens
who have lived good lives as if they were just ""pre-felons"" waiting to
commit crimes.

Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or

Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,

drive drunk, drive without it!

However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.
I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.

The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's
whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.
I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.
I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning
one, too.

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.

The biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the
availability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000
and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,
British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There
are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here
it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? He's from
California."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,
a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio
play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were
the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was
on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational
hockey for about 35 years.

Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for
the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,
cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club
dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues
cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.

By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""
areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an
industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther
King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west
of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.
Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive
to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them
give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee.

Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.
  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.
  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this
  code can Email me.

Subject: Revelations - BABYLON?
Organization: Muskingum College

Hello all.  We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We
have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable
interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the
woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the
Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents
Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some
views on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same
Babylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church?
Hate to step on toes.

[Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly
common in earlier Protestant writers.  A lot of us find that frankly
embarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocate
such a position.  The problem is that the description makes it look a
lot like a political entity.  It's associated with kings, controls
world commerce, is seated on seven mountains (17:9 -- recall that Rome
is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills).  If it's a church,
then it's not the current Roman Catholic church, but a church that has
been taken over by the anti-Christ and merged with the state, turning
into something rather different than it is now.  Presumably in such a
scenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted.  Given
the overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel of
light, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, I think the most
consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-Christ
would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both
the Protestant and Catholic traditions, but that the true spiritual
descendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally being
persecuted.  --clh]

Keywords: Eveism, religion, 
Nntp-Posting-Host: rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu
Organization: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY
Lines: 102

Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this
religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common.

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.

For example,

Story of Adam and Eve:
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited
supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide 
in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.
(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God.)

Traditional Philosophy:
1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will
provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.
2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler 
and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:
They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God
told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their ""Father"" said to.  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is ideal.  Get-
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.
3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.
4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for 
themselves.
5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.

1990's philosophy:
1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless
named ""Hillary Clinton"" or ""Murphy Brown"".
2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people 
(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:
They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge
and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-
selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the ""real world.""

Lessons from new interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is at best
a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal.
3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.
4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and ""alter
or abolish"" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.
5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children (and themselves).

I have tentatively named this new philosophy ""The Church of Eveism"" because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead
of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it 
until it was actively sought.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
""the people"" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  ""... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ....""
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 ""The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.""
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask ""well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?""

Well, ""militia"" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
""militia"" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   ""The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time.""
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   ""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   ""And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   ""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States.""
     - Noah Webster, ""An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution"" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to

in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the

A professor of mine once said ""The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about $5000"" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than
the CS.
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the ""computer"" in your
car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.

P.S. The $5000 is not just a joke

I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here 
also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.

Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in
general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around
1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous
activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all
that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.

Joe Buehler

...

Schism and Disobedience

According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a
refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the
Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever
the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he
must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to
the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of
jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it
clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of
disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the
beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American
bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.

The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in
the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de
Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is
certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism
and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father
Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence
of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection
of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a
decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not
constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia
explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to
intend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  It
adds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this
character it must include besides the transgression of the command of
the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not only
does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,
but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and
his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made
his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: ""We pray
for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations
last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II
the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he
is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor
heresy.""

...

Intrinsically Schismatic?

The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in
schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is
an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a
consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is
not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it
would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917
Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see
Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to
excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic
church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops
differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre
as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,
that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the
illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise
an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the
bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of
jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of
ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and
also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way
the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of
bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the
ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the
primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman
Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the
Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in
response.

It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics
that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican
has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not
so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of
Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled
""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The
first part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the
Church"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon
1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together
with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses
against the unity of the Church.

But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this
canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against
religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his
excommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties for
Specific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of Ecclesial
Functions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum
Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is
Canon 1382, which reads: ""A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and
the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a
pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)
excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""

The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense
of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly
justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had
been convicted of first degree murder.

I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion
of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers
without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated
the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father
Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut
Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs
actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not
excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical
function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which
constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the
illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of
the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a
parallel Church.

Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the
Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations
in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to
imagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:

    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not
    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with
    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses
    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are
    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a
    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the
    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the
    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh
    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated
    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because
    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.

....

It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating
bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least
intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and
will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that
the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,
and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to
consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon
Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that
the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these
consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it
could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred
excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates
as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot
expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a
great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to
the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.

Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce
Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he
knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no
greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and
the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a
statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February
1989 Remnant merits careful study:

    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June
    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also
    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist ""obstinancies."" And from the
    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to
    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense
    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has ""an
    erroneous concept of Tradition."" If this were so, Cardinal
    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the
    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:
    ""Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it
    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to
    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern
    and shares it.""

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the ""right"" things
(where ""right"" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)
is showing an acute case of ""myopic social perspective"", not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity.

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public.  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the ""oughta-be's""
inside their own hopelessly closed minds.

I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.

Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain ""venom""
at all, let alone ""venom"" comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism.

A very serious tone in that oratory.

You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, 
BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.
He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).
This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated.

This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since
Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as ""the highest image of the Lord"" fits with Christian doctrine.

Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-
Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here.

Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here.

>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality

Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood.

90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control 
of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the ""right"" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. 
Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the ""young heads full
of mush"" hyperbole indicates.

Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.

Indication here that ""Elements of the Media"" (since career is a self-selected
categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.

You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who 
is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?

Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media.

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind, not the real world.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.

As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.
Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through ""business/government partnership"" and increased levels
of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school.

Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of
racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to
racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left.

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized
Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried

really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted
in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is
available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000
GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles?

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though
it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is
it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy
really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?

Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very
dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep
away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.

Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there
(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?
Is there something else that I could do?

A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?

Many thanks,

Vida.

Subject: Tickets - advice is worth what you paid
Organization: Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, California

I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory
advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an
opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is
extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't
know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code
only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a
wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any
advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.

If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,
study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really
happens.  Read ""Fight Your Ticket"" too, but don't miss the little
section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're
basically screwed.

As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in
California.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and
revealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with
the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the
message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying
his own cases.

So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic
school if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer
can present the exact same case as you, the difference is the
sentence.

If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned
into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and 
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
""tamperproof"" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that
""well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,
isn't it?""

Just some random thoughts...

  Simple -- if you have a choice between:

 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested
     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
     behavoir, or

 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption
     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
     the control of the user,

which would you choose?  At most, the American government can deny this
choice to American citizens (and probably not that, if the glorious success
of the War on Drugs is any example); it can't do much about the global market.

I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't

Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients

we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal

Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun 
militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how ""well regulated"" 
modifies ""militia"" is:
	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, ""wet""
	modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""

The amendment is similiar to the statement:
	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep

So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,
what does the ""unorganized militia"" have to due with the right to

No not, unconditional, but ""shall not be infringed"".  Infringed
is defined as:
	To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, 
	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
	To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
This definition implies the following of some form of existing 
agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries 
or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word 
""unconditional"" implies no agreements or all previous agreements 
are off, which is the opposite.

The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
""congress shall make no law,"" are much stronger.  They clearly 
	         ^^^^^^^^^^^
imply ""unconditional.""  If the writers of the amendment, wanted 
unconditional whay didn't they says, ""congress shall make no 
laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms""?
The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
the people from forming a ""well regutaled militia.""  The duties
of a ""well regulated militia"" to the government are descussed in 
Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control
of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II 
Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.

Why is that terrible ? That's exactly the way our code has been doing
it for two years now and is the way that temporary files in UNIX systems

	   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)
published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the
""energy signature"" of organic objects.

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water.

Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has
ammended laws to provide whatever is needed. Note that both Spacehab

The problems aren't legal nor technical. The problem is NASA's culture.

Rogers is the ""one-batter lefty"" in the bullpen.  Dusty has also said he
trusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is
unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin.  Then again, if
any of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to

I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned
Tyre (1990-92). Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,
copyright San Jose Mercury news):

---
  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people
and 
wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and
wounding 
75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in 
Nabatiye.
---
  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off

southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command 
said.
  
     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the 
motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The
army 
said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain 
guerrillas was not immediately known.
---
  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal 
battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled 
grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.
---
 Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had 
uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said
pro-
Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.
  
     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the
catacomb-
like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, 
Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles
south of 
Beirut.
  
     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
R. 
Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road 
outside Tyre in February 1988.
--------------
...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also
found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the
city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the
places
where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will
consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work
well enough for your purposes.

Hope this helps

I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  I can't use 3 chip simms in my

The CD300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  
now.  Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare.  I've seen them  
listed for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller.  I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,  
but I can't confirm it.

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year.

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way
to the Angels. But still challenge to the end.

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    
Nntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov
Organization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio
Lines: 76

NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you
folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently
discussed on sci.space are covered in this.

Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance

Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.

A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7
billion and a high option of $9 billion will be
considered by the committee. Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, Shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.

Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment. As a result, station options above $7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space
station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.

Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. Generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.

Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and
Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.

To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.

Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
However, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation.""

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-
West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland
under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,
such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. 
But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the
states. It was written to limit the federal government only. 
The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions
of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact
wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme
Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it
directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right
(indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the
state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that 
particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on
the Second Amendment.

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1).

After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have
a couple of questions I hope you can answer:

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to
the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean
and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike
is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do
I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
screwing it down before reading?

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on
the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?

My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter
replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?

As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia
has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders
ALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993
#1506

     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.

     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport
reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  

     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy
(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
Discovery.

     ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign.  

     ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" he
continued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,
and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
right.""

     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. 
Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.

     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL
instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight. 

     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.
Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon.

     ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""

     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward
their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS
scientists.    

     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon
Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a
contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was
launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.

     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh
between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The
scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.

     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements
Program.

The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs
by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday
afternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and
was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young
season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2
John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny
Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.
Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,
however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In
the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year
to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the
11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when
the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of
position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the
game.

The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

Piper lived in my town (Williamsport, PA) when he killed himself.  It
was in the early '60's.  He had had more than a few books published by
that time, but he was down on his luck financially.  Rumor was that he
was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  He viewed himself as
a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he
couldn't support himself.  The worst part is that John Campbell, the
long-time editor of Astounding/Analog SF magazine had cut a check for
Piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  If Campbell
had known Piper's straits, I'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on.
Campbell was like that.

I wish it had happened differently.  I always enjoyed Piper's stuff.

Absolutely.  Unfortunately, most of them have had 3 weeks of neurology
in medical school and 1 month (maybe) in their residency.  Most
of that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen.
Where are they supposed to learn?  Those who are diligent and
read do learn, but most don't, unfortunately.

We are the only ones, sometimes, who have enough interest in headaches
to spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them.  Too often,
the primary care physician hears ""headache"" and loses interest in
anything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out of
the office so they can get on to something more interesting.


>(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic).  Headaches

I hope you meant ""inarguably"".

Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17"" monitors recently
and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a
17"" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember
correctly, I think its viewing area is 16"" measured diagonally.

Thanks.

The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:
a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster.  

Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an 
embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying
some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition?

On the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final
verdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying ""Oops!  I forgot
to bring up this evidence,"" and demand a new trial.  You get one bite at
the apple.

It's up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation.
You'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same
stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  It's not
as if General Motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the
trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.

Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and 
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

>Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price 
>machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.

Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.
Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.

Can you spell ""loss leader?""  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader 
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  

But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide 
comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had 
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD 
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers 
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  
(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to
Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  

The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government 
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that ""government
bureaucracy"" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

with a tiny disclaimer at the end.  Check your facts first and grow up.
Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder.

Brent shows his ignorance once again.  Power had been cut for weeks.  And he's  
never lived in a rural area if he thinks electric stoves have favor there.   
They stop working when the power fails, and power restoration come MUCH slower  
in the country, than the city.  LP gas stoves and ovens are very much prefered.

Do they have a history of working in massage parlors, and telling

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and ""draw a blank"".

I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical
characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique
used, but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.
However, superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved
properties of my ciphertext could thwart this.

Not really, though I wouldn't personally say ""the most deserving
candidate wins"".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If

I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of
the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think
they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This
year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.
Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.

And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their
offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.
(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR
potential.)

Cheers,

Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and
re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless
cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

What will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded
goods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's
favor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-
check your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling
VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?

Indeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,
but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes
which are the units of genetics.

We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful
memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will
run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that
future technology has to offer.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions
against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at
CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid
Mary.

We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people
with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people
with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic
fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All
of which is subjective.  

What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There
is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective
in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality.  But there exists no objective morality.

Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion
is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what
we can _say_ about the physical world.

With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to
pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect
that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American
shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some
time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian
socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got
the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the
control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high
public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market
forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.

Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to
chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is
something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much
more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an
autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
also leads to cirrhosis.  

Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous
effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. 
Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,
among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic
circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of
hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. 
These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in
men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for
cirrhosis is liver transplant.

Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in
your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the
subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he
or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to
you, and offer you support.

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically 
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  
He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an 
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.

This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife.

   Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the proper

   1) Chelated Manganese   25-50mg/day.
   2) Chelated Chromium    400-600mcg/day.
   3) Increase protein through foods or supplements.
   4) Avoid supplements/foods high in Potassium, Calcium, Zinc.
   5) Avoid Vit C supplements in excess of 100mg.
   6) Avoid honey and foods high in simple sugars.
   7) Enjoy breads, cereals, grains...

   Discuss the above with your health practitioner for compatibility

If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short
program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function.
The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is
some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends
on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so
the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.

If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email
it to you. (It is unavailable via ftp.)
